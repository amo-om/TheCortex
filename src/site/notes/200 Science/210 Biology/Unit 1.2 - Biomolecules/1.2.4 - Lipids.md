# [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Lipids\|Lipids]] 
[[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Lipids\|Lipid]] building blocks ([[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Monomer\|monomers]]) are also known as **glycerol and fatty acids**. *They do not have a true [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Monomer\|monomer]]* but the STAAR will want glycerol and fatty acids TYPICALLY. 
>[!tip]- Glycerol

- **Triglyceride** - “three glycerides”
{ #e10dbb}

	- Triglycerides do not bond together, therefore [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Lipids\|lipids]] do not have a true [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Polymer\|polymer]] form.
# Functions
1. *Provide long term energy storage* 
2. *Provide insulation*
3. *Making biological membranes*
4. *Protection/Water Resistance*
5. *Acting as hormones*
# Form follows Function
- **Saturated Fatty Acid**
	- ==No double bond==, fats found **solid** at room temperature.
		- Ex. ==butter, fatty meat, waxes==
- **Unsaturated Fatty Acid**
	- ==One double bond==, fats found **liquid** at room temperature
		- Ex. ==olive oil, vegetable oil==

- **Phospholipids**
	- A phosphate group attached to fatty acid chains. Build and repair cellular membranes
		- Ex. ==phospholipid bilayer==

- **Steroids**: 
	- Have 4 carbon rings attached to a fatty acid chain. Steroids perform various functions in the cells and body
		- Ex. ==hormones, cholesterol==
