- [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Biomolecule\|Biomolecules]] are [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Polymer\|polymers]] (chains) of subunits called [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Monomer\|monomers]]
- [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Polymer\|Polymers]] are broken apart through [[hydrolysis\|hydrolysis]] (“water cutting”)
	- [[Periodic Table of Elements/And Compounds/Dihydrogen Oxide\|Water]] is broken into H and OH and used to break the bond between [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Monomer\|monomers]] ![Hydrolysis.png](/img/user/Files/Hydrolysis.png)
- [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Monomer\|Monomers]] are joined together through ==Dehydration [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Synthesis\|Synthesis]] Reactions== ![Dehydration Synthesis.png](/img/user/Files/Dehydration%20Synthesis.png)
