# Structure
- [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Proteins\|Proteins]] are made up of **[[Periodic Table of Elements/Carbon\|Carbon]], [[Periodic Table of Elements/Hydrogen\|Hydrogen]], [[Periodic Table of Elements/Oxygen\|Oxygen]], [[Periodic Table of Elements/Nitrogen\|Nitrogen]],** and sometimes **[[Periodic Table of Elements/Sulfur\|Sulfur]]**
## [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Monomer\|Monomer]]
- [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Proteins\|Protein]] **building blocks** are also known as **[[Amino Acids\|amino acids]]**. There are **twenty different types** of amino acids.
	- ==Amino Acid = [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Monomer\|Monomer]]==

## [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Polymer\|Polymer]]
- [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Proteins\|Protein]] [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Polymer\|Polymer]] â€” When many amino acids bond together to create long chains
- The [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Polymer\|polymer]] is called a [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Proteins\|protein]] and it is also called a **[[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Proteins\|polypeptide]],** because it has several **peptide bonds**
![polypeptide.png](/img/user/Files/polypeptide.png)
- Ex.
	- **Lactase**
		- An [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Enzyme\|Enzyme]] that breaks down the sugar (*lactose*) in milk. *If it ends in **ASE** it is an [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Enzyme\|Enzyme]]*
	- **Hemoglobin**
		- A [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Proteins\|protein]] that carries [[Periodic Table of Elements/Oxygen\|Oxygen]] in blood
	- **Actin and Myosin**
		- [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Proteins\|Proteins]] that aid in muscle contraction
- ==All enzymes are [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Proteins\|Proteins]] but not all [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Proteins\|Proteins]] are enzymes==
## Form follows function 
- The order of the amino acids determines the function/type of [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Proteins\|protein]] 
# Functions
1. **Build tissue and muscle**
2. *Speed up chemical reactions* (**enzymes**)
3. Aid in **hormone production**
4. **Transport** molecules in and out of the [[Cell\|Cell]]
