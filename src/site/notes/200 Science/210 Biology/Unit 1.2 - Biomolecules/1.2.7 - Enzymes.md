# Chemical Reactions
For a chemical reaction to take place, **the reactants must absorb enough energy so that the existing bonds will be broken and new bonds will be formed**, chemical reactions **ALWAYS** involves the ==breaking of bond in reactants and forming new bonds in products==
- A process that **changes** one set of **chemicals** into **another** set of chemicals
- **Reactants**: (*What goes into a reaction*)
- **Products**: (*What is made or results from a reaction*)
- **Activation Energy**: the amount of energy needed to **start** a reaction
## [[Catalyst\|Catalyst]]
- *A substance that speeds up the rate of* **chemical reactions**
- It *lowers* the activation energy for the reaction to occur
## [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Enzyme\|Enzymes]] 
- [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Enzyme\|Enzymes]] are catalysts, *a substance that speeds up the rate of* **chemical reactions**
- [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Proteins\|Proteins]] that act as biological catalysts
- [[Cell\|Cells]] use [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Enzyme\|enzymes]] to *speed up* chemical reactions that take place in the [[Cell\|Cell]]
- [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Enzyme\|Enzymes]] can be affected by:
	- **Changes in pH**
		- Change the [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Enzyme\|enzyme’s]] shape
	- **Changes in temperature**
		- can change the [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Enzyme\|enzymes]] shape
- **Activators**: make [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Enzyme\|enzymes]] work **faster** by **boosting** the [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Enzyme\|enzyme]] 
- **Inhibitors**: **slow down** or stop activity by being the way at the [[Active Site\|active site]] 
### Lock & Key Model
- [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Enzyme\|Enzymes]] complete very specific jobs
- The compounds they work with (**[[Substrates\|substrates]]**) are the “*key*”
### [[Active Site\|Active Site]]
- [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Enzyme\|Enzymes]] provide a **specific binding site**, called the [[Active Site\|Active Site]], where **reactants**(*[[Substrates\|substrates]]*) can be brought together to react
### [[Enzyme-Substrate Complex\|Enzyme-Substrate Complex]]
- The active site forms the [[Enzyme-Substrate Complex\|enzyme-substrate complex]] and is a very **specific shape**. It only allows the [[Substrates\|substrate]] that matches to bond with the [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Enzyme\|enzyme]] 
- It allows chemical bonds in the reactants to be broken and new bonds to form
	- The [[Active Site\|active sites]] are the **keyholes**
	- The [[Substrates\|substrates]] are the keys
