# [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Nucleic Acids\|Nucleic Acids]]
- [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Nucleic Acids\|Nucleic Acids]] are made of the [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Monomer\|monomer]] **Nucleotides**. They are made up of **[[Periodic Table of Elements/Carbon\|Carbon]], [[Periodic Table of Elements/Hydrogen\|Hydrogen]], [[Periodic Table of Elements/Oxygen\|Oxygen]], [[Periodic Table of Elements/Nitrogen\|Nitrogen]], and [[Periodic Table of Elements/Phosphorus\|Phosphorus]]**.  
## [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Monomer\|Monomers]] 
- ==Nucleotides have 3 parts==
	1. ==Sugar (deoxyribose for **[[200 Science/210 Biology/Unit 1.2 - Biomolecules/Deoxyribonucleic Acid\|Deoxyribonucleic Acid]]**, ribose for **[[200 Science/210 Biology/Unit 1.2 - Biomolecules/Ribonucleic Acid\|Ribonucleic Acid]]**)==
	2. ==Phosphate==
	3. ==Nitrogenous bases==
		- **[[200 Science/210 Biology/Unit 1.2 - Biomolecules/Deoxyribonucleic Acid\|Deoxyribonucleic Acid]]** → Adenine, ***Thymine***, Cytosine, Guanine
		- **[[200 Science/210 Biology/Unit 1.2 - Biomolecules/Ribonucleic Acid\|Ribonucleic Acid]]** → Adenine, ***Uracil***, Cytosine, Guanine
- Each **nucleotide** consists of 3 parts:
	- *nitrogen base* (C-N ring)
	- *pentose suga*r (5C)
		- **ribose** in [[200 Science/210 Biology/Unit 1.2 - Biomolecules/Ribonucleic Acid\|Ribonucleic Acid]]
		- **deoxyribose** in [[200 Science/210 Biology/Unit 1.2 - Biomolecules/Deoxyribonucleic Acid\|DNA]] 
	- *phosphate (PO<sub>4</sub>) group*

## [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Polymer\|Polymer]]
- *Nucleic Acid [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Polymer\|Polymer]]* — **When many nucleotides bond together to create a chain of [[200 Science/210 Biology/Unit 1.2 - Biomolecules/Deoxyribonucleic Acid\|Deoxyribonucleic Acid]] or [[200 Science/210 Biology/Unit 1.2 - Biomolecules/Ribonucleic Acid\|Ribonucleic Acid]]**
- The [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Polymer\|Polymer]] is ==[[200 Science/210 Biology/Unit 1.2 - Biomolecules/Deoxyribonucleic Acid\|DNA]] ([[200 Science/210 Biology/Unit 1.2 - Biomolecules/Deoxyribonucleic Acid\|deoxyribonucleic acid]]) which a double stranded== and ==[[200 Science/210 Biology/Unit 1.2 - Biomolecules/Ribonucleic Acid\|Ribonucleic Acid]] ([[200 Science/210 Biology/Unit 1.2 - Biomolecules/Ribonucleic Acid\|ribonucleic acid]]) is single stranded.==
- Two **polynucleotide**[^1] strands wrap around each other to form a [[200 Science/210 Biology/Unit 1.2 - Biomolecules/Deoxyribonucleic Acid\|Deoxyribonucleic Acid]] **double helix**.
	- **Complementary Base Pairing** —
		- **Adenine always bonds with Thymine**
		- **Cytosine always bonds with Guanine** 
	- A—T, C—G, producing **base pairs**
# Form follows Function
- Basic instructions for living things (**blueprints for [[Cell\|cells]]**)
- Make up components of genetic information **([[200 Science/210 Biology/Unit 1.2 - Biomolecules/Deoxyribonucleic Acid\|Deoxyribonucleic Acid]]/[[200 Science/210 Biology/Unit 1.2 - Biomolecules/Ribonucleic Acid\|Ribonucleic Acid]]) in all living things**
- ==The fact that all living things have [[200 Science/210 Biology/Unit 1.2 - Biomolecules/Deoxyribonucleic Acid\|Deoxyribonucleic Acid]] is always tested. The sequence (order) of [[200 Science/210 Biology/Unit 1.2 - Biomolecules/Deoxyribonucleic Acid\|Deoxyribonucleic Acid]] can be different but **ALL** living things HAVE [[200 Science/210 Biology/Unit 1.2 - Biomolecules/Deoxyribonucleic Acid\|Deoxyribonucleic Acid]] in their [[Cell\|cells]].==
- ==The order of the nitrogen bases determines the genetic makeup of the individual==
- [[200 Science/210 Biology/Unit 1.2 - Biomolecules/Deoxyribonucleic Acid\|Deoxyribonucleic Acid]] is **double stranded** and is coiled up into the shape of a [[Chromosome\|Chromosome]] that is linear (**looks like an X**) in [[Eukaryotic\|eukaryotic cells]]. It is packaged in a [[Nucleus\|nucleus]], humans have 46 [[Chromosome\|chromosomes]] in each [[Cell\|Cell]].
	- [[200 Science/210 Biology/Unit 1.2 - Biomolecules/Deoxyribonucleic Acid\|DNA]] sequence is copied into [[200 Science/210 Biology/Unit 1.2 - Biomolecules/Ribonucleic Acid\|Ribonucleic Acid]] this is called transcription
	- [[200 Science/210 Biology/Unit 1.2 - Biomolecules/Ribonucleic Acid\|Ribonucleic Acid]] sequence is translated into amino acids sequence ([[200 Science/210 Biology/Unit 1.2 - Biomolecules/1.2.6 - Proteins\|proteins]])
	- Amino acid sequence determines the [[200 Science/210 Biology/Unit 1.2 - Biomolecules/1.2.6 - Proteins\|protein]] shape and function

# [[Periodic Table of Elements/And Compounds/Adenosine Triphosphate\|Adenosine Triphosphate]]
- *[[Periodic Table of Elements/And Compounds/Adenosine Triphosphate\|Adenosine Triphosphate]]*
	- *Adenine* nucleotide
	- **Three total phosphate groups**
- High energy bond between phosphates are broken
	- Releasing energy for the [[Cell\|Cell]]
		- [[Periodic Table of Elements/And Compounds/Adenosine Triphosphate\|Adenosine Triphosphate]] → [[Adenosine Diphosphate\|ADP]] ([[Adenosine Diphosphate\|Adenosine Diphosphate]])
