There are four types of [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Biomolecule\|Organic Compounds]] that form the cells of living things
1. [[200 Science/210 Biology/Unit 1.2 - Biomolecules/1.2.2 - Carbohydrates#Carbohydrates\|Carbohydrates]] 
	1. (simplest = sugars)
2. [[200 Science/210 Biology/Unit 1.2 - Biomolecules/1.2.4 - Lipids#Lipids Lipids\|Lipid]]
3. [[200 Science/210 Biology/Unit 1.2 - Biomolecules/1.2.6 - Proteins\|Proteins]]
4. [[200 Science/210 Biology/Unit 1.2 - Biomolecules/1.2.5 - Nucleic Acids#Nucleic Acids\|Nucleic Acids]]
- Molecules are typically classified as [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Biomolecule\|biomolecules]] ([[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Biomolecule\|Organic Molecule]] ) if they contain various combinations of the following elements:
	- [[Periodic Table of Elements/Carbon\|Carbon]] - C
	- [[Periodic Table of Elements/Hydrogen\|Hydrogen]] - H
	- [[Periodic Table of Elements/Oxygen\|Oxygen]] - O
	- [[Periodic Table of Elements/Nitrogen\|Nitrogen]] - N
	- [[Periodic Table of Elements/Phosphorus\|Phosphorus]] - P
	- [[Periodic Table of Elements/Sulfur\|Sulfur]] - S
# [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Carbohydrates\|Carbohydrates]]
- Made of **simple sugars**
- Made up of different combinations of **[[Periodic Table of Elements/Carbon\|Carbon]], [[Periodic Table of Elements/Hydrogen\|Hydrogen]], and [[Periodic Table of Elements/Oxygen\|Oxygen]]** 
- **Quick energy** source for plants and animals
- **Structural component** of plants and animals
- **Biological recognition device**
The building blocks of [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Carbohydrates\|Carbohydrates]] are also known as **saccharides**, which is another word for **sugar**. There are three types of sugars:
- **[[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Monosaccharide\|Monosaccharide]]** — “**one sugar**”
{ #8733b7}

	- These are [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Carbohydrates\|carbohydrate]] [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Monomer\|monomers]] are commonly called “**simple sugars**.” Examples are glucose or fructose 
- **[[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Disaccharide\|Disaccharide]]** — “**two sugars**”
	- Composed of two [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Monosaccharide\|monosaccharides]] combine, such as sucrose and lactose 
- **[[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Polysaccharide\|Polysaccharide]]** — “**many sugars**”
	- These are long chains of **[[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Monosaccharide\|monosaccharides]] connected together** (*[[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Polysaccharide\|Polysaccharide]]/[[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Polymer\|Polymer]]*) that form substances such as **starches and glycogen** 
		- Glycogen
			- ==Animal Food Storage==
		- Starch
			- ==Plant Food Storage==
# Form follows Function
- ***Starch has a different structure than glycogen because they serve different functions.***
- Starches are **forms of energy** (*food*) **storage in plants**, so the molecules form lines that can them be wound into tight coils, providing fast energy access.
