# Adaptations
An adaptation is a trait shaped by natural selection that makes it better suited to its environment
- Some adaptations involve changes in the structure of body parts: **[[Mimicry\|mimicry]]** and **[[camouflage\|camouflage]]**
- [[Mimicry\|Mimicry]] is where one species evolves to resemble another species
	- **enables an organism to copy the *appearance of another species***

>[[Survival of the Fittest\|Survival of the Fittest]]: Those that are “fit” will have a greater chance of passing on genes
>[[Adaptation\|Adaptation]]: A trait that allows an organism to be well suited to live in its environment, chosen for by years of natural selection
- [[Camouflage\|Camouflage]] is an adaptation that allows [[Organism\|organisms]] to become almost invisible to [[Predators\|predators]]
	- Structural adaptation that enables an organism to **blend in with its surroundings**
