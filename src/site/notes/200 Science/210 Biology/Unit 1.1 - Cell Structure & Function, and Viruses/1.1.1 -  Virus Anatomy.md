# [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Virus\|Viruses]]
A [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Virus\|virus]] is a **non-cellular particle made up of genetic material & protein that can invade living [[Cell\|cells]].**
1. [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Virus\|Viruses]] are not [[Cell\|cells]]
2. [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Virus\|Viruses]] cannot reproduce by themselves
	- They ***must*** have a [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Host\|Host]]
3. [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Virus\|Viruses]] do not use energy
4. [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Virus\|Viruses]] do not respond to the environment
5. [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Virus\|Viruses]] do not respire, metabolize or grow
## Types of [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Virus\|Viruses]]
### [[Bacteriophage\|Bacteriophage]]
- [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Virus\|Viruses]] that attack ==bacteria== are called ==[[Bacteriophage\|bacteriophages]]==
### [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Retrovirus\|Retrovirus]]
- HIV, the AIDS, is a [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Retrovirus\|Retrovirus]]
- Starts with [[200 Science/210 Biology/Unit 1.2 - Biomolecules/Ribonucleic Acid\|Ribonucleic Acid]] → makes [[200 Science/210 Biology/Unit 1.2 - Biomolecules/Deoxyribonucleic Acid\|Deoxyribonucleic Acid]] → then moves forward
## Characteristics/Structure
- [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Virus\|Viruses]] have a protective coat called the [[Capsid\|capsid]]
- Have a core containing genetic material ([[200 Science/210 Biology/Unit 1.2 - Biomolecules/Deoxyribonucleic Acid\|Deoxyribonucleic Acid]]/[[200 Science/210 Biology/Unit 1.2 - Biomolecules/Ribonucleic Acid\|Ribonucleic Acid]])
- Some [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Virus\|viruses]] have [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Glycoproteins\|projections]] to help attach to the [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Host\|Host]] [[Cell\|Cell]]
	- aka. [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Glycoproteins\|Glycoproteins]]
- Most [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Virus\|viruses]] infect only ***==specific==*** [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Host\|Host]] cells
	- The flu (influenza) attaches to lung tissue
	- HIV only affects immune cells specifically T-cells
- They may also have a viral envelope made up of [[200 Science/210 Biology/Unit 1.2 - Biomolecules/1.2.4 - Lipids#^868bba\|phospholipids]].
- [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Virus\|Viruses]] lack many things [[Cell\|cells]] have
	- No [[Nucleus\|nucleus]]
	- No organelles
	- No [[Cytoplasmic Membrane\|cell membrane]]

## Treating/Preventing [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Virus\|Viruses]]
Most of the time, treating people with a [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Virus\|Virus]] involves treating symptoms, like cold symptoms can be treated with cold medicine. [[Antiviral\|Antivirals]], on the other hand, work directly on the [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Virus\|Virus]]

>[!faq]- Why do you have to get a flu shot every year?
>Your body creates memory cells to remember how to fight a disease.
>
>However, some [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Virus\|viruses]] mutate and change. The body does not recognize this mutated [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Virus\|Virus]].
