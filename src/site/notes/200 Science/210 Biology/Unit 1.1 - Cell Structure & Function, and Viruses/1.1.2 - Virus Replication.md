# Viral Replication
- [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Virus\|Viruses]] have **two** different ways of reproducing
	- [[Lytic Cycle\|Lytic]] → A [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Virus\|Virus]] **quickly** replicates and creates disease symptoms (DAYS)
	- [[Lysogenic Cycle\|Lysogenic]] → A [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Virus\|Virus]] infects [[Cell\|cells]] and remains **dormant** while being copied (YEARS)
