# [[Homeostasis\|Homeostasis]]
>[[Homeostasis\|Homeostasis]] is the regulation and maintenance of the internal environment
- ==Conditions within the body must stay within a narrow range==
	- [[Homeostasis\|Homeostasis]] involves keeping the **internal environment** *within set ranges*
**Control systems** help maintain [[homeostasis\|homeostasis]]
- **Sensors**: Gather data
	- [[senses\|senses]]
- **Control Center**: receives data, interprets info, sends messages out
	- [[Brain\|Brain]]
- **Communication System**: delivers messages to target [[organs\|organs]], tissues
	- PNS (e.g. motor [[Flashcards/Health Science/PHS/neuron\|neurons]])
- **Targets**: respond to change
	- [[Muscles\|Muscles]], [[glands\|glands]] (release [[hormones\|hormones]])

- A disruption of [[homeostasis\|homeostasis]] can be harmful
- ==Homeostasis can be disrupted for several reasons==
	- Sensors fail (don't detect changes)
	- Targets do not receive messages ([[nerve\|nerve]] issues)
	- Injury (overwhelm homeostatic controls)
	- Illness ([[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Virus\|Viruses]] or [[Bacteria\|Bacteria]])
>Disruption of [[homeostasis\|homeostasis]] can begin in one organ and cause a chain reaction in the others therefore causing a major body disturbance.
## Feedback Loops
> Feedback occurs when outputs of a system are routed back as inputs as part of a chain of cause-and-effect that forms a circuit or loop. The system can then be said to feed back into itself.
### Negative Feedback Loops
- Negative feedback loops are necessary for [[homeostasis\|homeostasis]]
- Feedback compares **current conditions** to the body’s **comfort levels**
- ***Negative feedback*** counteracts change and brings the body back to [[homeostasis\|homeostasis]]
#### Example
1. Holding breath, CO2 levels rise[[200 Science/210 Biology/Unit 3.2 - Interactions Among Systems/3.2.1 - Homeostasis#^c456ad\|#^c456ad]]
{ #3f1e1e}

2. Control system forces exhale, inhale[[200 Science/210 Biology/Unit 3.2 - Interactions Among Systems/3.2.1 - Homeostasis#^8657be\|#^8657be]]^c456ad
3. O2/CO2 level returns to normal[[200 Science/210 Biology/Unit 3.2 - Interactions Among Systems/3.2.1 - Homeostasis#^3f1e1e\|#^3f1e1e]]^8657be
### Positive Feedback Loops
- Positive feedback increases change away from the set points, which is need for rapid change in the bloody
#### Examples
1. Torn blood vessels stimulate the release of clotting factors to stop blood flow
2. Growth hormones stimulate cell division
3. Labour for pregnant women
	- This causes the release of [[oxytocin\|oxytocin]] for contractions 
## Thermoregulation
>The process of maintaining a steady body temperature under a variety of conditions
>Systems involved:
>- [[Muscular System\|Muscular]]
>- [[Integumentary System\|Integumentary]]
>- [[Respiratory System\|Respiratory]]
>- [[Circulatory System\|Circulatory]]
>- [[Nervous System\|Nervous]]
>- [[Endocrine System\|Endocrine]]
