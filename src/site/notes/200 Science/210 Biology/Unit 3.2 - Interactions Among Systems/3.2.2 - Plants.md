# Organs of Plants
1. **Roots**: absorbs [[Periodic Table of Elements/And Compounds/Dihydrogen Oxide\|water]] & nutrients
2. **Stems**: transport of [[Periodic Table of Elements/And Compounds/Dihydrogen Oxide\|water]] and nutrients; support
3. **Leaves**: site of [[photosynthesis\|photosynthesis]], make [[glucose\|glucose]] for the plant

# Tissues of Plants
1. **Dermal** — controls interactions with plants' surroundings
2. **Vascular** — transports nutrition and fluids
	- *Phloem* — transports ***==FOOD==*** from leaves to other parts of the plant
	- *Xylem* — transports ==***[[Periodic Table of Elements/And Compounds/Dihydrogen Oxide\|WATER]]***== from roots up to leaves
3. **Ground** — tissue that is neither vascular nor non-vascular
---
## Phloem
- ==Transports the sugar [[sucrose\|sucrose]] from the leaves to the parts of the plant that need it==
- **Part of the vascular system**
- *Can also transport [[Periodic Table of Elements/And Compounds/Dihydrogen Oxide\|water]]* 
## Xylem
- ==Transports [[Periodic Table of Elements/And Compounds/Dihydrogen Oxide\|water]] and minerals from the roots up through the plant==
- **Part of the vascular system**
- *Can also transport hormones to parts of the plant that need it*

## Roots
- Taproot (ex: Carrot)
- Fibrous Root (ex: Grass)
==Roots grow from the root cap, which is continuously dividing through [[mitosis\|mitosis]]==

*Root Hairs- increase surface area for absorbing [[Periodic Table of Elements/And Compounds/Dihydrogen Oxide\|water]] and nutrients from the soil*
## Stem
- ==Support for leaves, flower and fruit==
- **Keep the leaves in the sunlight**
- **Provide a place for growth of flowers and fruit**
- *Transport fluids between the roots and the shoots*
