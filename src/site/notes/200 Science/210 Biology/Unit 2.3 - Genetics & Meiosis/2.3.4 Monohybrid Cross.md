# Punnet Square
A punnet square is a chart that allows you to determine the expected percentage (**probability**) of different genotypes in the offspring of two parents.
>[!tip]-
>Parents = Pgeneration
Offspring = F<sub>1</sub>Generation
Offspring of F<sub>1</sub> = F<sub>2</sub>Generation
## Keywords
- **Genotype** - the genetic makeup of an organism
	- *Think of it as the actual ‘code’ that determines traits*
	- ‘Gene’ type - genes are code
Phenotype - the observable traits of an organism
- **Phenotype** - the observable traits of an organism
	- *Think of it as how the organism actually looks*
	- ‘Ph’ as in ‘Physical’ appearance
- **Allele** - ***one of two or more alternative forms of a gene*** that arise by **mutation** and are found at the same place on a chromosome
	- *These are represented by letters in our genotype*
## Monohybrid Crosses
- A cross that shows the **possible offspring for one trait**

Genotypic Ratio: 1:2:1
Phenotype: 3:1
