# Cell Reproduction/[[Mitosis\|Mitosis]]
- The **process of producing new cells from existing cells**
- New cells are **genetically identical** to parent cell
	- This is **asexual reproduction** (only o**ne parent cell involved**)
## Reasons of Cell Division
**Mitosis** is for eukaryotes only
1. Too ***BIG***
	1. (**Surface are to volume ratio is small: inefficient osmosis & diffusion**)
2. **To replace damaged or dead cells**
3. **For growth and development**
	1. (**embryo**)
4. **Advantages**
	1. **Speed**
	2. **Replacement**
	3. **Preserving desirable characteristics**
