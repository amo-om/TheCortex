# Notes
## Elements of the [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Cultural Landscape\|Cultural Landscape]]
**Geographic patterns of cultural traits and practices create unique cultural landscapes,** including physical, industrial, agricultural, and architectural features.
### Physical Landscape
- Encompasses natural physical surroundings, such as r**ocks, soil, vegetation, climate, landforms, rivers, lakes, mountains, plains, and deserts.**
- Anything not **built, created, molded, or shaped by humans is part of the physical landscape.**
- **Cultural influence can be seen in how humans shape the physical landscape,** 
	- Ex. well-manicured gardens in affluent(rich) neighborhoods.
### Industrial and Economic Landscape
- **Reflects a society's economic activities and includes features like factories, highways, warehouses, malls, and more.** 
- **Some features may contribute to a sense of [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Placelessness\|Placelessness]] due to standardization.**
- **Distinctive industrial and economic features can symbolize a [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 1/Region\|Region]]'s [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Cultural Landscape\|Cultural Landscape]],**
	- Ex. Factories being placed next to rivers
### Agricultural Landscape
- **Dominant in rural areas and includes various types of agriculture.**
- **Different regions have unique agricultural landscapes**
	- Ex. Corn fields in the Midwest, terraced rice paddies in Southeast Asia, and tulip fields in the Netherlands.
- **Fishing docks and other features related to obtaining food from the environment are part of the [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Cultural Landscape\|Cultural Landscape]].**
### Indigenous Architecture in the Landscape
- Housing is a **fundamental human need, and societies have developed diverse architectural forms.**
- **Indigenous and local architecture is often more connected to the physical landscape and materials of the [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 1/Region\|Region]].**
	- Ex. Nipa huts in the Philippines, made of bamboo and nipa leaves, designed to adapt to local environmental conditions.
### Postmodern Architectural Landscapes
- Urban areas **feature modern and postmodern architecture.**
- Modernist architecture is **functional, rational, and characterized by straight lines and open spaces.**
- Postmodern architecture is more **dramatic and creates a spectacle while serving various functions.**
- **Postmodern architecture encourages creativity and the combination of old and new elements in urban landscapes.** 
	   - Ex. Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain. ![Hildebrhgap1e_un0319_06_314.webp](/img/user/Files/Hildebrhgap1e_un0319_06_314.webp)

## Sequent Occupance
Sequent occupance shows how **places have been influenced or controlled by different groups over time, reshaping their functions and meanings and leaving behind layers of significance.**
### Transformation of Spaces:
- **Old buildings or sites repurposed due to economic or social changes show sequent occupance.** 
	- Ex. a former textile mill becoming an upscale restaurant or condominium demonstrates the evolving layers of meaning within a landscape.
### Impact:
- **Cities, over long periods of time, witness the impact of multiple cultural groups.** **Jerusalem, for instance, has been under the control of numerous empires, including the Persians, Greeks, Romans, and Ottomans.**
- The [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Cultural Landscape\|Cultural Landscape]] of Jerusalem embodies a ***convergence* of political, cultural, and ethnic groups that have been in the area across different epochs.**
	- Ex. The Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, a site revered by Muslims as the place where the prophet Muhammad ascended into heaven, stands next to the Western Wall, an old remnant of the ancient Jewish temple, **showcasing the intertwining of multiple cultural and religious influences within the city.**
- Successive societies can either **demolish old cultural symbols or adopt and integrate them into their own, resulting in a complex [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Cultural Landscape\|Cultural Landscape]] that is made up of many diverse influences.**

## [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Ethnicity\|Ethnicity]] in the Landscape
**Ethnic and racial landscapes often diverge from the dominant culture's landscapes**, **displaying distinctive *architectural styles*, land survey patterns, and building distribution that signify the presence of specific ethnic or racial groups in the [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Cultural Landscape\|Cultural Landscape]].**
- **Ethnic and racial markers in the landscape can be visible, but they can also be noticeable through other senses such as smell or taste.** **For example, walking by street food vendors might let one to smell the aroma of ethnic cuisine, revealing the cultural context of the area.**
- **Ethnic flags and monuments can serve as prominent symbols, contributing to the [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Cultural Landscape\|Cultural Landscape]]**. **These markers can incite various responses within the community, particularly in relation to historical figures or events.**
	- Ex. Statues of Confederate generals
- **Urban environments often showcase ethnic cultural landscapes**. An example is the vibrant  murals commonly found in Mexican American ethnic neighborhoods in the southwestern US.
	- These murals, which emerged in the 1960s in Southern California, **combine influences from Spanish and indigenous Mexican cultures.** They are most commonly found in many urban places like apartments, store exteriors, bridge supports, and highway underpasses.
	- The murals cover a many subjects, **including religious motifs, political ideologies, historical grievances, and urban [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 6/Zoning Laws\|zoning]] conflicts**. **Often, they are deeply connected to the local landscape elements, enhancing the sense of place and cultural identity.**
	- Writing on the murals may be in Spanish or English, but **many Mexican murals rely on imagery and vibrant colors to convey their message.**
	- **Urban ethnic neighborhoods result from internal cultural dynamics and exclusionary policies,** like linguistic profiling, [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 6/Redlining\|redlining]], and ethnic steering, created these neighborhoods as refuge from cultural hostility beyond their boundaries.

## Linguistic Landscapes
### Cultural Representation
- Elements like road signs and public displays show the dominance of a particular language in a [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 1/Region\|region]]. **They also show the coexistence of multiple languages, highlighting bilingual or multilingual areas.**
### Reflection of Linguistic Dynamics
- **Linguistic landscapes not only show linguistic diversity but can also expose instances of linguistic oppression against minority languages**. This may be evident through **the removal or marginalization of certain languages in public displays.**
### Challenges of Understanding
- **Different writing systems can render some linguistic landscapes incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the writing forms.** This diversity in writing systems may present challenges in readability and understanding for those outside the linguistic or cultural group.
## Religious Landscapes
### Sacred Spaces
   - **Sacred spaces encompass locations that possess religious significance, and they can vary from natural sites like mountains or rivers to human-made places such as churches, temples, or shrines**. These spaces play a major role in **reflecting the presence of religious beliefs within a [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Cultural Landscape\|Cultural Landscape]].**
### Secularization and Changing Landscapes
- **In some societies, increasing secularization has led to reduced religious influence or control. Consequently, non-religious sites can acquire a secular version of sacredness.** 
	- Ex. **Ground Zero in New York City serves as a secular sacred space where people pay their respects to the victims of the September 11, 2001 attacks.**
### Evolution of Cultural Significance
- The evolving [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Cultural Landscape\|Cultural Landscape]] reflects the changing nature of religious and secular influences. Sites that may not be inherently religious can still take on a significant role in shaping cultural identity and values.

## Cultural Messages in the Linguistic Landscape
### Political Expression
- **Linguistic landscapes often convey political content, encompassing issues related to power dynamics, dominance, subjugation, and freedom.**
	- Ex. Turkey's suppression of the Kurdish language, **where broadcasting, publishing, and even naming children in Kurdish was prohibited. Speaking Kurdish could lead to arrests and imprisonment.**
### Interpretational Challenges
- **Not all elements of the [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Cultural Landscape\|Cultural Landscape]] are universally understood.** Some landscapes are intentionally designed to convey meaning to specific groups while remaining cryptic to others.
- **Graffiti, for example, can signify territorial ownership or convey messages.** **Understanding these symbols often requires knowledge of subcultural dialects and highly stylized scripts, making misinterpretation potentially dangerous, especially in unfriendly or unfamiliar territory.**
>[!tip]-
>When analyzing a [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Cultural Landscape\|Cultural Landscape]], go beyond identifying its cultural elements. Make sure that you also explain the processes that are changing the landscape.
Heritage and History in the [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Cultural Landscape\|Cultural Landscape]]
## Heritage and History in the [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Cultural Landscape\|Cultural Landscape]]
### Symbolism of Built Environment:
- **Elements of the built environment—buildings, shrines, public art, and monuments—convey the history of a place**, indicating its ownership, the identities welcomed, and the things that happened there.
### [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Race\|Race]], [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Ethnicity\|Ethnicity]], and Historical Narratives:
- **Cultural narratives about a place often prominently feature [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Race\|Race]] and [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Ethnicity\|Ethnicity]].** The colors used in painting buildings can signify specific ethnic territories, and **countries portray their national history through monuments and statues denoting crucial historical places.**
	- In the United States, the [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Cultural Landscape\|Cultural Landscape]] **reflects the legacy of the Civil War, with monuments and statues often honoring individuals associated with the war, including slave owners, sparking debates about their place in public spaces.**
### Conflict Over Cultural Elements:
- **Monuments and statues representing a *contentious* historical past have become focal points of conflict. There are calls for their removal due to their association with a racist history, while others argue they represent historical accuracy and influential figures from their time.**
- **The removal of such contentious symbols has led to protests and clashes, with the process often conducted under protective measures and police presence, particularly evident in the removal of Confederate landmarks in the United States.**
### Global Context of Conflict:
- **Similar conflicts over cultural landscapes commemorating historical eras have occurred globally, leading to iconoclasm**—**destruction of religious or political elements in the landscape.** This includes the destruction of **statues and monuments representing repressive leaders or historical figures associated with colonialism or oppression.**
## Cultural Attitudes in the Landscape
## Public Responsibility for Cleanliness:
- Japan's landscape **reflects a lack of public trash cans in major areas, which emphasizes the communal responsibility for cleanliness.**
- T**he strict trash collection practices and even superhero figures promoting civic duty show the importance placed on public cleanliness.**
## Responses to Historical Events:
   - **Historical events influence cultural responses in the landscape.** For instance, in Japan, the reduction of public trash cans following the 1995 sarin gas attacks is to how air travel is perceived as a security risk in the U.S. post-9/11.
## Cultural Identity in the Landscape:
   - **The landscape conveys tangible cultural features, such as architectural and agricultural elements, as well as deeper cultural identities related to [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Ethnicity\|Ethnicity]], language, and religion.**
   - **These cultural elements in the landscape reflect how societies interact with their environment, express their identity, and uphold cultural values.**
# How does this connect to your life and experiences?
This relates to my life as it reminds of the [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Cultural Landscape\|Cultural Landscape]] I'm apart of.
# Question
>[!faq]- Is it possible to have a [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Cultural Landscape\|Cultural Landscape]] completely unrelated to the cultural identity of the people
