# Notes
## Diverse Cultures
### Formation of Subcultures
- **Subcultures can form through resistance to dominant cultural norms or as a manifestation of separate identity within a larger cultural context.**
- **Material practices and the *reinterpretation* of mass-produced goods play a significant role in the creation of distinct subcultural identities.**
### Diversity in [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Popular Culture\|Popular Culture]]
- Contemporary popular cultures encompass a wide range of identities, **with terms such as LGBTQ, hip-hop, NASCAR, punk, and grunge representing distinct subcultures. These subcultures often exhibit unique geographic expressions.**
- **The list of emerging subcultures is nearly infinite, showcasing the dynamic nature of cultural identities in today's society.**
### Global [[400 Social Studies/410 AP Human Geography/Unit 3/3.1 - Creating Culture#Diffusion of Culture\|Diffusion]] of [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Popular Culture\|Popular Culture]]
- **Popular cultures are no longer confined to specific regions;** they are **diffusing globally and influencing unexpected places.**
	- Ex. **American-style break dancing gaining popularity in Cambodia in the twenty-first century, showcasing the bidirectional flow of cultural influence.**
### Cross-Cultural Impact
- **Cultural influence is not limited to one direction; Japanese and Korean pop culture, for instance, has found a significant presence in the United States, while U.S. pop culture has gained popularity in Japan and Korea.**
- The accessibility of **streaming platforms, like Netflix, has facilitated the global reach of cultural content, such as K-dramas from South Korea.**
### Evolution of Culture
- **Culture is in a constant state of change, with new forms and expressions continually emerging.**
- **K-pop bands from South Korea, for example, now regularly tour in the United States, highlighting the expanding market and cultural influence of these subcultures.**

## [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Acculturation\|Acculturation]] and [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Assimilation\|Assimilation]]
### Generational Changes in Cultural Expression
- **Over time, if immigrant families stay in a new location for several generations, there is a shift in cultural expression.**
- The grandchildren of immigrants **may lose some cultural distinctiveness, assimilating more into the host culture while retaining a few cultural elements from their grandparents.**
- **[[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Assimilation\|Assimilation]] goes beyond [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Acculturation\|Acculturation]], signifying a blending into the host culture and the potential loss of many distinctive ethnic traits.**
- **Intermarriage is a significant force in [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Assimilation\|Assimilation]], while some groups encourage endogamy to preserve cultural distinctiveness.**
	- Ex. **German Americans, despite being the largest [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Ethnicity\|ethnic group]], experienced a decline in cultural influence due to factors such as anti-German sentiment during World War I.**
- **The [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Assimilation\|Assimilation]] of German Americans involved concealing cultural distinctiveness and blending into the broader American culture.**
### Changing Perspectives on [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Multiculturalism\|Multiculturalism]]
- **[[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Multiculturalism\|Multiculturalism]] has become a key goal in many societies, emphasizing the importance of cultural diversity.**
- **Cultural initiatives today often aim at greater representation of underrepresented voices and challenge the historical norm of [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Assimilation\|Assimilation]].**
### Shift from Melting Pot to Salad Bowl Metaphor
- **The concept of the "melting pot" has given way to the metaphor of a "salad bowl," where racial and ethnic differences mix without complete dissolution.**
- T**he resurgence of ethnic identity globally suggests that transculturation, involving the adoption and contribution of elements between cultures**, may better capture the dynamic interaction among cultures.
- **The decline in the push for cultural [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Assimilation\|Assimilation]] has led to a recognition of the ongoing intermixing of cultures**.
- Scholars, particularly in the context of [[North America\|North America]], **have shifted from the melting pot analogy to the salad bowl metaphor, recognizing that cultural differences persist over time.**
>[!tip]-
>The core of this Unit is understanding cultural diffusion and being able to explain its effects. Know the details of cultural issues (such as syncretism, [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Multiculturalism\|Multiculturalism]], and globalisation) with the aim of being able to explain the broader processes that shape changing cultural patterns and practices. Be prepared to apply these concepts to new contexts on the exam.

## Cultural Syncretism
### Syncretic and Orthodox Religions
- **Syncretic religions combine elements from two or more different belief systems.**
	- Ex. Umbanda in Brazil **blends Catholicism with indigenous reverence, European spiritism, and historical Brazilian figures.**
- **Caribbean and Latin American religious practices showcase a syncretic blend of European, African, and indigenous American elements.**
 - **Orthodox religions emphasize purity of faith and resist blending with other belief systems.**
	- Ex. [[400 Social Studies/410 AP Human Geography/Unit 3/3.9 - Geography of the Abrahamic Religions IP#Christianity\|Christianity]], [[400 Social Studies/410 AP Human Geography/Unit 3/3.9 - Geography of the Abrahamic Religions IP#Judaism\|Judaism]], Hinduism, and [[400 Social Studies/410 AP Human Geography/Unit 3/3.9 - Geography of the Abrahamic Religions IP#Islam\|Islam]] have orthodox strains.
 - I**ntolerance of other religions, associated with fundamentalism, differs from the tolerance often seen in orthodoxy.**
### Catholicism:
- **The conquest of the Americas led to the violent religious conversion of indigenous peoples to [[400 Social Studies/410 AP Human Geography/Unit 3/3.9 - Geography of the Abrahamic Religions IP#Christianity\|Christianity]].**
- **Syncretism in the Americas involved the blending of indigenous Mexican beliefs with European Catholicism.**
	- Ex. The Virgin of Guadalupe, **a symbol of Mexican Catholicism, seamlessly combined European and indigenous American symbols.**
### Sikhism
- **Sikhism, with around 30 million adherents, shows religious syncretism on a [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Misc./Large Scale\|large scale]]**.
- **Originating in the Punjabi [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 1/Region\|region]], Sikhism emerged around 1500, distinct from Hinduism and [[400 Social Studies/410 AP Human Geography/Unit 3/3.9 - Geography of the Abrahamic Religions IP#Islam\|Islam]] but connected to both.**
- **Sikhs broke with the Hindu caste system, adopted certain Hindu concepts, and appreciated Muslim saints while developing unique rituals and beliefs.**
- **Sikhism's [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Relocation Diffusion\|Relocation Diffusion]] has spread it beyond its Punjabi [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Hearth\|Hearth]] to various countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Kuwait, the United States, Australia, and East African and Southeast Asian countries.**
### Religion in the Face of Globalization
- **Religion is often viewed as a stable anchor amid globalisation, providing a sense of community and stability.**
- **Religions adapt to the changing world to retain believers, leveraging customs, meetings, and obligations.**
- **Increased mobility and communication allow for global religious communities, with the internet playing a significant role in shaping worship and fostering online faith communities.**
