# Notes
## Sense of Place
**"Sense of place" refers to the unique traits and physical characteristics that shape people's perceptions of a location**. It is **influenced by the elements present in the [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Cultural Landscape\|Cultural Landscape]] and the broader cultural patterns of a [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 1/Region\|Region]].** Places and regions that stand out  from their surroundings are said to possess a "strong sense of place."
### Distinctive Cultural Traits
- **Places with a strong sense of place often exhibit distinct characteristics that are challenging to describe but collectively contribute to a unique identity. The "feel" of a neighborhood or community, often intangible, plays a major role in shaping the overall sense of place.**
### Emotional Connection
- **A sense of place is a subjective and emotional connection that people feel towards a location, even if they cannot articulate it in words.**
### Tangible Expressions in the Built Environment
- **Tangible elements in the built environment, such as architecture, attractive amenities, and essential services, are consciously made in many communities to create a vibrant community with a strong sense of place.**
	- Ex. theaters, street markets, restaurant districts, community parks, shopping districts, and public art displays, **all contributing to changes in the built environment that enhance the [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Cultural Landscape\|Cultural Landscape]].**
### Economic and Cultural Significance
- **The distinctiveness and differences visible in a [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 1/Region\|Region]]'s landscape can serve as both cultural and economic assets.** These unique traits **contribute to the [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 1/Region\|Region]]'s identity and appeal, attracting tourism and shaping the local economy, therefore contributing to the sense of place.**
### Tourism and Political Implications
- **Tourism often relies on promoting a strong sense of place, creating a carefully crafted image that carries political and economic implications.**
	- **Catalonia's tourism literature, makes itself seem like a culturally distinct Mediterranean country**, emphasizing cultural differences with the rest of Spain, **leading to political tensions.** 
	- **Paris uses its distinctive cultural traits as a charming aspect of its [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Cultural Landscape\|Cultural Landscape]] to attract tourists.**

## Placemaking
### Community-Centric Vision
- Residents wanting a lively cultural hub often support placemaking, **advocating for diverse local events in public spaces.** The goal is to foster **a sense of community and provide residents with a range of cultural interactions.**
### Diverse Initiatives
- **Placemaking involves various efforts by community organizers, city planners, and other stakeholders to bring people together, boost local spending, and enhance civic morale.**
- **Events such as arts festivals, celebrations of [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Local Culture\|Local Culture]], and agricultural fairs are common placemaking strategies** that impact how individuals perceive and engage with their living spaces.
### Active Shaping of [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Cultural Landscape\|Cultural Landscape]]
- **Placemaking emphasizes the idea that the [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Cultural Landscape\|Cultural Landscape]] is not just a passive reflection of society but a dynamic thing actively shaped by communities.** Societies work actively to create, mold, and reshape public spaces to convey specific messages and reflect their values.
### Contentious Nature
- **Given differing opinions on what makes a good community and how to shape it, placemaking can be a source of contention.**
- **Disputes may arise when some community members feel that the [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Cultural Landscape\|Cultural Landscape]] only presents an official history, omitting what they consider the "true" history**. Such disagreements often revolve around the power to control cultural messages and the ability to make changes to public places.
### Power Dynamics in [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Cultural Landscape\|Cultural Landscape]]
- **The fight for control over the messages conveyed in the [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Cultural Landscape\|Cultural Landscape]] is a central theme in placemaking.** Individuals and groups may engage in efforts **to assert their narratives and influence the portrayal of community heritage.**

>[!tip]- 
>When looking at centripetal and centrifugal forces, remember that cultural features (language, religion, [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Ethnicity\|Ethnicity]], etc.) are not just on one side or the other. Focus on the processes that create the geographic context.

## Centripetal Forces

**Centripetal forces are those that bring people together and foster unity within a neighborhood, society, or country.** 
### Religion as a [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Centripetal Force\|Centripetal Force]]
- **Shared religious beliefs can serve as a [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Centripetal Force\|Centripetal Force]], unifying a community or [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/Nation\|nation]].** 
	- **In postcolonial India, [[400 Social Studies/410 AP Human Geography/Unit 3/Modules 18-24/Module 23#Hinduism\|Hinduism]] played this role, with a majority of the world's Hindus residing in the country.** 
	- **In Pakistan, [[400 Social Studies/410 AP Human Geography/Unit 3/3.9 - Geography of the Abrahamic Religions IP#Islam\|Islam]] has been designated as a unifying force by the British during decolonization, shaping cultural and political unity.**
### Language and [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Ethnicity\|Ethnicity]]
- **Linguistic similarity is another powerful [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Centripetal Force\|Centripetal Force]] that promotes cohesion and community building.** In [[Europe\|Europe]], the shift from [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Ethnicity\|Ethnicity]] to language as a primary marker of national identity reflects how a common language can unify diverse populations.
- **[[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Ethnicity\|Ethnicity]] itself can act as a [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Centripetal Force\|Centripetal Force]], binding groups together through shared cultural traits, identities, and heritage**. 
	- Ex. Japanese [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Ethnicity\|Ethnicity]] is a unifying force in Japan, encouraging individuals of Japanese ancestry to connect with their "ancestral home."
### Cultural Displays and Placemaking
   - **Ethnic neighborhoods, like Little Italy or Chinatown in New York City, use cultural displays such as restaurants, signs, street markets, flags, and music to proudly showcase their [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Ethnicity\|Ethnicity]]**. These cultural elements reinforce historical [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Misc./Migration\|Migration]] patterns and contribute to a sense of unity within the community.
   - Ethnic identity, acts as a [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Centripetal Force\|Centripetal Force]], **and becomes a key component in placemaking efforts, where residents may actively work to maintain the ethnic character of their neighborhoods.**
   --- 
## Centrifugal Forces
Centrifugal forces are elements that threaten the cohesion of a neighborhood, society, or country, pushing people apart or creating divisions within the community. 
### Religious Differences
- **Religious diversity within a society, especially when distinct religious groups coexist, can act as a [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Centrifugal Force\|Centrifugal Force]].** 
	- **In countries with both [[400 Social Studies/410 AP Human Geography/Unit 3/3.9 - Geography of the Abrahamic Religions IP#Sunni\|Sunni]] and Shi'ite populations, such as Iraq, Syria, and Yemen, religious differences have been linked to political conflicts, creating divisions within the nation.**
- **The clash between traditional religious values and secularization, where religion becomes less dominant in daily life, can also lead to cultural conflicts.** In societies where segments hold traditional religious values while others embrace secularization, **these differing perspectives contribute to cultural and political tensions.**
### Linguistic Division
- **Linguistic diversity, especially in regions with challenging terrains like the Caucasus Mountains, can pose challenges to cultural cohesion.** **Historical isolation due to rugged landscapes has led to distinct linguistic developments in different valleys.**
	- **In the Caucasus region, linguistic diversity has been a [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Centrifugal Force\|Centrifugal Force]] since the end of the Cold War, contributing to political upheaval as linguistic, religious, and ethnic groups seek autonomy from the Russian government.** 
	- **Lack of linguistic and cultural cohesion adds to political instability, with conflicts arising over changing political borders.**
### [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Ethnicity\|Ethnicity]] as a [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Centrifugal Force\|Centrifugal Force]]
- **Ethnic identity, while can be unifying force within a community, can also act as a [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Centrifugal Force\|Centrifugal Force]] when based on differences from surrounding neighborhoods**
	- **Chinatowns in West Coast cities, were established in the 1800s due to Chinese exclusion from other parts of major cities**. 
	- **While Chinese ethnic identity bound the community together locally,** **it became a [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Centrifugal Force\|Centrifugal Force]] at the [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Misc./Regional Scale\|regional scale]], dividing Californians as Asian [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 2/Immigration\|Immigration]] reshaped the state's ethnic composition.**
# How does this connect to your life and experiences?
