# Notes
## Barriers to Diffusion
- **Distance decay limits the ability of some cultural traits to diffuse to faraway locations**
-  **Absorbing barriers** are any barriers that completely stop the diffusion of a cultural trait. An absorbing barrier could be a mountain range, an ocean, a political institution, a legal code, or a cultural [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Taboo\|taboo]].
- **More common are permeable barriers, which allow ideas to diffuse partially and in a weakened way.**
## Interaction Leads to Linguistic Change
- **People who speak different languages but need to interact on a basic level can find some common ground by using a pidgin language,** **characterized by a very small vocabulary derived from the languages of at least two or more groups in contact.**
	- **Mainly for trading purposes**
	- **Does not have complex vocab or grammar**
	- Ex. Tok Pisin
		- Means "talk business"
		- **It's mainly an English-derived pidgin spoken in Papua New Guinea**
		- New Guinea pidgin is not easily understood to a speaker of standard English, certain common words, such as gut bai (“goodbye”), tenkyu (“thank you”), and haumas (“how much”) reflect the influence of English.
- **When pidgin languages acquire fuller vocabularies and become native languages of their speakers, they are called creole languages.**
- **Sometimes a language is considered a lingua franca, a language that is spoken across a wide area where it is not a native tongue.**
## Colonialism and Imperialism
- **Empires are sovereign political entities that seek to expand beyond their origin territory to control more territory politically and/or economically.** 
- **Some empires expanded through peaceful means, but often empire building was bloody and oppressive.** 
- **Imperialism is the motivating impulse to control greater amounts of territory.** 
- **Colonialism is the act of forcefully controlling a foreign territory, which becomes known as a colony.**
- **Colonialism and imperialism have been at the root of many atrocities in human history. i.e. Racism, Dehumanization**
## Technology, Language, and Empire
- **The most basic and  influential technology for diffusing language is writing**. The invention of writing appears to have **developed as early as 5300 years ago in several focused geographic areas, including Egypt, Iraq, and China.** 
	- **Writing helped civilizations develop and spread, giving written languages a major advantage over those that were only spoken.** 
	- **Written languages can be published and widely distributed, and they carry with them the status of standard, official, and legal communication.**
	- **Written language facilitates record keeping, helping governments and empires to develop**

# How does this connect to your life and experiences?
This connects to my experiences as I've noticed it takes much longer for foreign foods to be widespread, meaning it's passing through a permeable barrier. 

# Key Questions
>[!faq]- What are the types of diffusion?
>Stimulus, Relocation, Expansion, Contagious, Hierarchical, Reverse Hierarchical

>[!faq]- How can global forces create new forms of cultural expression?
>Global forces can create new forms of cultural expression by influencing the exchange of ideas, technologies, and values between different cultures, leading to the emergence of hybrid or evolved cultural expressions. (Uniculturism??)

>[!faq]- How did colonialism, imperialism, and trade shape cultural patterns and practices?
>Colonialism, imperialism, and trade interwove cultures, reshaped traditions, languages, and social structures through the exchange of ideas, goods, and power dynamics.
