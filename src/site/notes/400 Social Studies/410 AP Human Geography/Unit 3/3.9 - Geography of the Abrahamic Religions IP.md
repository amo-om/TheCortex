**Some Muslim women wear full-body garments that only expose the eyes**, although there is no Quranic text requiring this. Some **cover every part of the body except their face and hands**. Some believe only their **hair or their cleavage is compulsory to hide, and others do not observe any special dress rules.**[^1]

> **Minarets** are a type of tower usually built into or next to mosques. Minarets are generally used to project the Muslim call to prayer from a muezzin(a man who calls Muslims to prayer), but they also served as landmarks and symbols of Islam's presence.

Islam **prohibits Muslims from consuming pork, alcohol or mind-altering drugs**. **Muslims are required to eat meat that is butchered and blessed in an Islamic way. This meat is called “halal.”** Muslims are also prohibited from gambling, taking interest, fortune-telling, killing, lying, stealing, cheating, oppressing or abusing others, being greedy or stingy, engaging in sex outside of marriage, disrespecting parents, and mistreating relatives, orphans or neighbours.
