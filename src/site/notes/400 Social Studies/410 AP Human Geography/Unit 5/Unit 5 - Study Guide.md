## [[Agriculture\|Agriculture]]
- Agriculture involves planting and harvesting domesticated plants and raising domesticated animals for food.
- Farmers may grow only crops, raise only animals, or do both.
>[!tip]-
>Questions on the APHG exam combine Units and concepts. Agricultural practices are cultural choices, but choices are limited by the physical environment. Know enough physical geography to explain why agricultural patterns are the way they are.
## Environmental Conditions
- The three most important elements of physical geography for [[agriculture\|agriculture]] are soil, topography, and climate.
### Soils
- Suitable soils for [[agriculture\|agriculture]] have a crumbly texture, a rich amount of organic materials, and diverse populations of microorganisms.
- The decomposition of organic matter creates an upper layer of topsoil that contains essential nutrients for plant growth.
### Topography (Landforms)
- Topography, such as mountains, plateaus, plains, hills, and valleys, affects the type of [[agriculture\|agriculture]] practiced.
### Climate
- Climate is the average pattern of weather over a 30-year period and plays an important role in determining the success of different kinds of [[agriculture\|agriculture]].
## Types of Agriculture
- Agriculture can be divided into two broad categories: [[intensive agriculture\|intensive agriculture]] and [[extensive agriculture\|extensive agriculture]].
### [[Intensive Agriculture\|Intensive Agriculture]]
- Requires high levels of labor and financial capital.
- Types of intensive agricultural practices include [[Market Gardening\|Market Gardening]], plantation agriculture, mixed crop/livestock agriculture, paddy rice agriculture, grain agriculture, livestock fattening, and dairy farming.
#### [[Market Gardening\|Market Gardening]]
- A small-scale farming system that produces a diverse mixture of vegetables and fruits, mostly for sale in local and regional markets.
- Ideal climate types for market gardening are marine west coast, mediterranean, and humid continental climates.
#### [[Plantation Agriculture\|Plantation Agriculture]]
- Involves the specialized production of a single tropical or subtropical crop for the global marketplace.
- Individual [[plantations\|plantations]] maximize the production of a single crop through [[Monocrop Culture\|monocropping]].
### [[Extensive Agriculture\|Extensive Agriculture]] 
- Requires minimal labor and capital in relation to the land area being farmed. It often involves low-intensity farming and the use of large land areas per unit of yield
- **[[Shifting Cultivation\|Shifting Cultivation]]**:
    - A farming practice common in tropical lowlands and hills in the Americas, Africa, and Southeast [[Asia\|Asia]].
	- Involves cultivating a plot of land until it becomes less productive over a period of about three to five years. When productivity drops, the farmer shifts to a new plot of land that has been prepared by slash-and-burn agriculture.
- **[[Nomadic Herding\|Nomadic Herding]]**:
	 - A form of extensive livestock grazing that involves moving herds of animals to find fresh pastures. 
		 - This practice is common in arid and semi-arid regions where the availability of forage is limited.
	- Herders move with their animals to areas with seasonal changes in rainfall and vegetation to ensure a sustainable supply of food for the livestock
- **[[Livestock Ranching\|Livestock Ranching]]**:
	- A form of extensive agriculture that involves raising grazing animals, such as cattle, sheep, and goats, over large land areas. This practice is common in regions with abundant grasslands.

## [[Intensive Agriculture\|Intensive Agricultural Practices]] and the Rural Landscape
- Agricultural landscapes, which cover 33.3% of the world's land area, are the visible imprints of agricultural practices, such as rice paddies, barns, or feedlots.
- These landscapes can vary over short distances, reflecting local agricultural practices.
- Different types of farming practices create distinctive agricultural landscapes.
### [[Market Gardening\|Market Gardening]] and Truck Farming
- The landscape for market gardening and truck farming depends on the type of product raised, the climate, and the market where the products are sold.
- In areas where markets are regional or global, the landscape is characterized by open level fields or orchards where vegetables or orchard crops are the primary crops.
### [[Plantations\|Plantations]] 
- Plantations are typically located in vast, relatively flat areas near coastal regions, laid out in linear patterns for ease of cultivation and harvesting.
- The landscape associated with plantation farming is characterized by cleared and cultivated areas in the tropics and subtropics for crops such as sugar, tea, coffee, bananas, and oil palm.
### [[Mixed Crop/Livestock Farming\|Mixed Crop/Livestock Farming]]
- Mixed crop/livestock farming takes place around small villages where families live at the edges of the fields.
- The agricultural landscape in regions with mixed crop/livestock farming shows a small, tightly clustered village surrounded by fields.
### Paddy Rice Farming
- The agricultural landscape for paddy rice farming is diked, flooded rice paddies, some of which are placed on top of terraced hillsides.
### Grain Farming
- The agricultural landscape for grain farming is distinguished by vast fields of grain that can cover hundreds of acres.
- The most obvious structures in the grain belt are the grain elevators that store grains.
### Livestock Fattening
- Large feedlots in which beef cattle are raised for meat are physical evidence of livestock fattening operations.
- The landscape includes slaughterhouses and corn and soybean fields where food for the animals is grown.
### Dairy Farming
- The landscapes of dairy farming differ depending on the practice.
	- The landscape for the traditional family dairy farm includes the home, barns, and other outbuildings, plus fenced pastures and fields for crops.
	- In feedlot dairy operations, there are large buildings for shelter and perhaps a separate milking parlor, or barn, where cows are milked.
## [[Extensive Agriculture\|Extensive Agricultural Practices]] and the Rural Landscape
- The agricultural landscapes of extensive agricultural practices are less visible than the landscapes for intensive agricultural practices.
### [[Shifting Cultivation\|Shifting Cultivation]]
- The agricultural landscape of the tropical areas in which shifting cultivation is practiced is composed of clearings that show a mix of active, newly abandoned, long abandoned, and newly cleared areas throughout a broad area surrounding each village.
### [[Nomadic Herding\|Nomadic Herding]]
- Because mobility is key to nomadic herders, nomadic herding leaves less of a permanent imprint on the landscape.
- The basic needs for the family and animals, such as tents and pens, are limited and moved from place to place along with the herds.
### [[Livestock Ranching\|Livestock Ranching]]
- The landscapes of livestock ranching include an open range, permanent dwellings, and small buildings for ranch workers and storage.
## Rural Settlement Patterns
- Rural settlement patterns are the ways in which people organize themselves on the land.
- There are three primary rural settlement patterns: clustered, dispersed, and linear.
### Clustered Settlements
- In many parts of the world, farmers group together in clustered settlements, also known as farm villages.
- These tightly bunched settlements have anywhere from a few dozen to several hundred inhabitants.
### Dispersed Settlements
- The dispersed or isolated settlement pattern, in which families live relatively distant from one another, is less common than the clustered farm village.
- A relatively recent form of settlement, it developed during the European colonization of new farmland in Anglo America, [[Australia\|Australia]], New Zealand, and South Africa.
### Linear Settlements
- In a linear settlement pattern, buildings are arranged in a line, often along a road or river.
- This pattern is limited to areas where legal systems dictated that property lines must be rectangular.
## Survey Methods
- Most countries have some form of cadastral survey, a systematic documentation of property ownership, shape, use, and boundaries.
- There are regional differences in survey methods that result in specific patterns.
### [[Metes & Bounds\|Metes & Bounds]]
- The metes and bounds survey system uses natural features such as trees, boulders, and streams to delineate property boundaries.
- As a result, farms surveyed under the metes and bounds system are much more varied in outline than those in which rectangular surveying was used.
### [[Township & Range\|Township & Range]]
- A survey system created by the U.S. Land Ordinance of 1785.
- It divides the country into a grid of 6 mi. by 6 mi. squares.
	- Each of these townships were divided into 36 sections, 1 square mile each.
- It is known as the “brainchild” of Thomas Jefferson, and used across the Midwest and West.
### Long Lot
- A unit-block survey system like [[Township & Range\|Township & Range]], whose basic unit is a rectangle, usually 10 times longer than wide
- Long Lot makes a pattern that allows farmers to get equal/easy access to fertile land, water, and access to transportation.
- Appeared lots in colonial America.

>Apply what you’ve learned about diffusion in other Modules (especially relocation and contagious diffusion) to agricultural patterns.
## Plant and Animal Domestication
   Agriculture started with domestication. A long process which involves selective breeding, protection, and care of plants and animals taken from the wild. This process creates genetically distinct species called domesticates. Domestication is a gradual, constant process resulting from thousands of years of close association between hunter-gatherers and the natural environment.
   - *Trial and Error*: Domestication is not a singular event but a continuous trial-and-error process.
   - *Association with Environment*: Hunter-gatherers learned to control fire, perfect tools, and establish more reliable food sources over thousands of years.
   - *First Agricultural Revolution*: The culmination of these advances led to the domestication of plants and animals, marking the First Agricultural Revolution.
### **Plant Domestication**
   Understanding the process involves recognizing the deliberate planting, protection, and care of plants. Teosinte, a wild grass native to Mexico, exemplifies the plant domestication process. 
   - *Teosinte Domestication*: Early people in Mesoamerica initiated domestication with teosinte, evolving it into modern corn through selective breeding.
   - *Selective Breeding*: Domesticates are genetically distinct due to selective breeding, resulting in larger and more abundant produce.
   - *Role of Women*: Women in hunter-gatherer societies likely played a significant role in early plant domestication.

3. **Geographic Aspects of Plant Domestication**
   Carl Sauer proposed that domestication independently developed at various times and locations, diffusing[^1] outward. 
   - *Sedentary Lifestyle*: Sauer argued that domestication occurred among settled, not migratory, groups with enough food to experiment.
   - *Unsuitable Regions*: Domestication likely avoided grasslands or large river floodplains due to difficulties in working with thick sod and coping with periodic floodwaters.
   - *Biodiverse Regions*: Original domestication areas were likely in regions of great biodiversity, providing ample material for experimentation.
4. **Animal Domestication**
   Domesticated animals, dependent on humans for food and shelter, underwent significant changes from their wild ancestors. The process, except for the dog, likely followed plant domestication.
   - *Mutually Beneficial Interaction*: Recent theories suggest that animals actively sought contact with humans, fostering mutually beneficial interactions.
   - *Important Domesticates*: While various animals were domesticated, only cows, sheep, goats, pigs, and horses achieved global importance.
5. **Hearths of Domestication**
   Identifying early hearths of plant and animal domestication is crucial. Archaeological research points to four subregions: Southwest Asia, China, South and Southeast Asia, Malaysia, Africa, and the Americas.
   - *Southwest Asia*: A major center for plant and animal domestication around 10,000 years ago, giving rise to cereal grains and major herd animals.
   - *Fertile Crescent*: Origin of grains like wheat, barley, rye, oats, and the domestication of grapes, apples, and olives.
   - *Indus River Valley*: Contributed to the domestication of plants, especially dry rice and wheat, and herd animals.
   - *China, South and Southeast Asia, Malaysia*: Independent domestication of crops and animals, including rice, soybeans, sugarcane, bananas, taro, water buffalo, and pigs.
   - *Africa*: Gave rise to peanuts, yams, coffee, barley, wheat, rice, sorghum, and a possible third [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Hearth\|Hearth]] for cattle domestication.
   - *The Americas*: Mesoamerica, a crucial center for maize, tomatoes, beans, and squash domestication; South America domesticated llama, alpaca, guinea pig, and Muscovy duck.
6. **Diffusion of Domesticated plants and Animals**
   The spread of domesticates occurred primarily through expansion diffusion, where traders facilitated their movement. The Columbian Exchange in the 15th and 16th centuries intensified global diffusion.
   - *[[Expansion Diffusion\|Expansion Diffusion]]*: Domesticates spread through traders and interactions, reaching Eurasia and Africa.
   - *[[Columbian Exchange*\|Columbian Exchange*]]: Interaction and transfer of plants, animals, culture, technology, disease, and ideas between the Americas, West Africa, and the Old World.
   - *[[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Relocation Diffusion\|Relocation Diffusion]]*: Agricultural products and practices were carried across oceans by explorers, impacting regions through the transfer of ideas.
   - *Modern Diffusions*[^1]: Ongoing diffusion of crops, animals, and innovations across the globe, contributing to multidirectional exchanges.
7. **Impact of Diffusion**
   - *Cultural Exchange*: Diffusion led to cultural exchange, altering diets, practices, and landscapes globally.
   - *Unintended Consequences*: Introduction of new crops, like potatoes in Europe, led to unintended consequences, such as the Irish Potato Famine in the 19th century.
   - *Continued Global Diffusion*: Agricultural diffusion, rooted in the First Agricultural Revolution, laid the foundation for subsequent agricultural transformations.

## The Second Agricultural Revolution
### Overview
The Second Agricultural Revolution, which lasted from the late 1600s to the 1930s, brought major changes to [[Agriculture\|Agriculture]] and society. It was characterized by improved methods of cultivation, harvesting, and storage of farm produce. This revolution occurred independently in different regions as technology advanced and diffused throughout the industrializing world.
### Technology and Agricultural Productivity
#### Mechanization of [[Agriculture\|Agriculture]]
Key inventions during this period included the seed drill, the steel plow, the mechanical reaper, and the tractor. These inventions increased efficiency and productivity in farming. Railroads and shipping canals also became increasingly important for shipping and selling agricultural products.
- **Seed Drill and Steel Plow**: The seed drill, invented by Jethro Tull in 1701, improved the efficiency of planting seeds. The steel plow, incorporated into a plow's design by John Deere in 1833, was lighter and stronger than previous plows, leading to greater efficiencies.
- **Mechanical Reaper**: Patented by Cyrus McCormick in 1831, the mechanical reaper increased grain yields by mechanizing the harvesting process.
- **Tractor**: The development of the internal combustible engine in the late-nineteenth century led to advancements in tractors, which increased efficiency and saved on manual labor.
- **Railroads and Shipping Canals**: These provided farmers with affordable access to distant markets, making it cheaper to transport produce and grain crops from farms to city markets and ports.
#### Agrichemicals
The development of agrichemicals, chemical compounds made from petroleum and natural gas for use in [[Agriculture\|Agriculture]], was a major contributor to the Second Agricultural Revolution. Synthetic fertilizers and pesticides increased crop yields and reduced crop losses from pests.
### Impact of Agricultural Productivity on Farming Societies
#### Better Diet and Increased Population
**The Second Agricultural Revolution led to an increase in agricultural productivity,** which **improved people's diets and increased the population size.** Better diets led to healthier people, longer life expectancies, and higher rates of population growth.
#### Economic Shift
The increase in agricultural productivity also led to a shift from primarily subsistence farming to the production of cash crops. This shift had both positive and negative impacts on rural social structure and ecological [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 1/Sustainability\|Sustainability]]. As farmers began to focus on growing cash crops, the diversity of farm output declined, and farming to meet the family’s needs changed to farming for market demands.
#### Changes in Family Structure and Women's Roles[^1]
The shift from subsistence farming to cash crop farming led to changes in family structure and women's roles. Older children began to leave farms to work in towns and cities, and women often found off-farm work to earn cash. The shift toward factory production of products like cheese moved production away from farm women to factory workers, leading to changes in women's roles in the local economy.
#### Impact on the Environment
The use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides became extensive in modern [[Agriculture\|Agriculture]]. While these advancements led to the ability to provide food for the growing urban populations, they also led to a decreasing need for farm labor to plant and harvest the crops. Many unemployed farm laborers migrated to the cities to work in factories.

>Green Revolution is aka the third agricultural revolution 
## Downsides of Irrigation
- Two significant downsides to irrigation are soil salinity and groundwater depletion.
  - Soil salinization is the **concentration of dissolved salts in the soil, resulting from poor irrigation practices in areas with poor drainage.**
  - *High soil salinity is toxic to most plants and soil organisms, affecting land productivity.*
  - ==Groundwater depletion is caused by the large volume of water required for Green Revolution irrigation==, leading to a **severe decrease in groundwater in irrigated areas,** raising concerns about water scarcity.
## Development and Use of High-Yield Seeds
- **The Green Revolution refers to the US-supported development of high-yield seed varieties and agricultural technologies for use in less developed countries.**
- It was **built on scientific advances in plant breeding, synthetic fertilizers, and chemical pesticides, bringing larger harvests to subsistence farmers.**
- **The three primary characteristics** of the Green Revolution are the ==development and use of high-yield seeds, increased use of synthetic fertilizers and chemical pesticides, and increased irrigation and mechanization.==
## Increased Use of Synthetic Fertilizers and Chemical Pesticides
- The Green Revolution brought the development of *high-yield seed varieties, requiring large amounts of synthetic fertilizers and chemical pesticides to meet their yield potential.*
- This led to larger harvests but tied the farmer to greatly increased expenses for hybrid seeds, synthetic fertilizers, chemical pesticides, an irrigation [[infrastructure\|infrastructure]], and mechanized farm equipment.
## Irrigation and Mechanization
- Irrigation infrastructure is essential for high crop yields made possible by Green Revolution technology.
- Paddy rice farming is an example of the development of irrigation methods, which required flooded paddies for the growth of seedlings to maturity and harvest.
- Irrigation projects included regional dam construction, piped water, irrigation pumps, and mechanical dikes to villages and individual farmers, leading to double-cropping in many areas.
## Increased Crop Productivity
- The Green Revolution led to increased crop productivity, decreased world hunger, and more efficient use of agricultural land.
- Overall rice production in [[Asia\|Asia]] grew 66 percent between 1965 and 1985 due to the innovations of the Green Revolution.
## Expense of Seed, Fertilizer, and Mechanization
- The negative effects of the Green Revolution include the cost of seed, fertilizer, and mechanization, loss of subsistence farming, plant diversity, genetic variety, food security, and a widening gap between rich and poor farmers.

## Agricultural Production

### Subsistence Agricultural Production Regions
- [[Subsistence agriculture\|Subsistence agriculture]] is food production mainly for consumption by the farming family and local community, rather than principally for sale in the market.
- Subsistence agricultural practices predominate in regions that are less economically developed, such as Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia, East Asia, and Latin America.
### Commercial Agricultural Production Regions
- The primary aim of commercial agriculture is profit maximization.
- Commercial agricultural farmers produce crops for off-farm sales rather than personal consumption.
- Many commercial farms are large, with hired laborers and high capital expenditures.
- Regions with commercial agricultural practices are located in the developed world.
## Bid-Rent Theory
- Bid-rent theory explains how the demand for and price of land decreases as its distance from the [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 6/Central Business District\|central business district]] increases.
- Different land users will compete with one another for land close to the city center.
- ==Intensive agricultural practices such as market gardening and dairy farming are willing to purchase land that is closer to the market at a higher cost per acre because their products are perishable and do not travel well.==
- Extensive agricultural practices such as potato farming often require large areas to plant and harvest the crop. These farms are located farther from the market, where the land is less expensive and more available.
## Large-Scale Commercial Operations
- Large-scale commercial operations practice [[monocropping\|monocropping]]([[monoculture\|monoculture]]), producing one crop, such as wheat, on extensive tracts of land.
- These operations are owned by a family, nonfamily corporations, or cooperatives that are run by member farmers.
## Family Farms
- A family farm is a farming operation majority-owned by a family or family corporation that sells its products to some defined market, either directly or through a cooperative.
- The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA/ERS) classifies family farms by gross annual sales: Small (gross cash farm income (GCFI) less than $350,000), Midsize (GCFI between $350,000 and $999,999), Large (GCFI between $1,000,000 and $4,999,999), Very large (GCFI of $5,000,000 or more).
## Family-Held Farms and Large-Scale Commercial Operations
- The number of family-held dairy farms in the United States has dropped from its peak in 1935.
- The decline of family dairy farms reflects the pattern in the United States for all family-held farms in that production has shifted to larger farms.
- Production has been shifting to larger farms for many years. Family and nonfamily farms with $1 million in annual gross cash farm income (GCFI) accounted for half of the value of U.S. farm production in 2015, up from about a third in 1991.
## Commodity Chains
- ==In agriculture, a commodity is a primary product that can be bought and sold, such as chicken, coffee, rice, or milk.==
- A commodity chain is a series of links connecting a commodity’s places of production, distribution, and consumption.
- Each link along the chain adds value to the commodity, producing differing levels of profit for the place and the people where production occurs.
## Poultry Production
- Over the past half century, poultry farming has fundamentally changed, and it now operates along the commodity chain.
- The farmer signs a contract with an agribusiness, a large corporation that provides a vast array of goods and services to support the agriculture industry.
## Industrial Inputs
- Pesticides and synthetic fertilizers, developed in the 20th century, are majour in conventional agriculture.
- The Green Revolution increased farmers' reliance on industrial inputs such as synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides.
- Artificial fertilizers stimulate crop growth, and pesticides reduce crop losses, leading to major increases in yields per acre of many crops.
- This has increased the carrying capacity of the available agricultural land and the profits of large commercial farms due to economies of scale.
- Farmers now rely on concentrated feeds and synthesized vitamins, hormones, vaccines, and antibiotics for livestock.
- Concentrated feed reduces the need for extensive areas needed to feed the animals and allows for confined feeding, which some consider cruel.
- Hormones stimulate animals' growth rates and boost the efficiency with which they convert feed into meat, shortening production time.
- Vaccines and antibiotics are needed to combat the spread of diseases in closely confined animals.
- These industrial inputs have reduced the need for extensive grazing areas, thus increasing the agricultural carrying capacity as more animals are raised in a smaller area.
## Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation (CAFO)
- A CAFO is an animal rearing system that confines livestock in high-density cages only large enough to allow the animal’s body to grow and to accommodate equipment for feeding and waste removal.
- Technology and the industrialisation of the livestock sector have increased economies of scale as farmers raise more animals in a shorter time frame and in less space.
## [[Mechanization\|Mechanization]]
- ==Nearly every part of the agricultural production process, from field preparation to harvesting, is now mechanized.==
- Industrialized farms are dependent on [[fossil fuels\|fossil fuels]] to run the cultivators and harvesters, pump the irrigation water, heat the buildings, and more.
- Machinery is growing ever more sophisticated and expensive, incorporating computer systems, lasers (for guiding plows and field leveling), drones (for soil and field analysis), and GPS.
- Greater [[mechanization\|mechanization]] has greatly increased labor productivity, meaning fewer year-round workers are needed in the fields.
## Cool Chains
- A cool chain is a system that uses refrigeration and food-freezing technologies to keep farm produce fresh in climate-controlled environments at every stage of transport from field to retail grocers and restaurants.
- Cool chains are the backbone of a food system that allows low-weight, high-value agricultural products to be flown to any major city in the world and sold fresh to shoppers less than 48 hours after harvest.
## Global Food System
- The global food system is the result of a decades-long trend of commercialization, industrialisation, and new technologies that have increased agricultural carrying capacity through increased productivity and economies of scale.
- The industrial model of food production and distribution developed largely in the United States and is now commonplace worldwide.

**Introduction**
- Bid-rent theory and von Thünen's model help explain spatial distributions in agriculture.
- Von Thünen combined bid-rent theory with transportation cost to understand agricultural distribution.
**Underlying Assumptions**
- Von Thünen's model relies on several assumptions:
   - No trade connections outside the modeled area.
   - One central market.
   - Uniform soil, climate, and flat terrain.
   - Equal farmer access to the market and profit maximization.
**Von Thünen's Original Model (1820s)**
- Divided into four concentric zones:
   - I: Dairy farming and market gardening
   - II: Forest for wood
   - III: Grains and field crops
   - IV: Ranching
- Reflects agricultural practices' relation to transportation costs and perishability.
**Revised Model with River**
- Improved transportation via navigable rivers influenced model adjustments.
- Dairy farming and market gardening follow river courses, extending outward from the center.
**Historic Patterns of Agricultural Production**
- Application to 1820s New York City shows similar patterns observed by von Thünen.
- Dairy farms near the city, grain farming in the hinterland.
