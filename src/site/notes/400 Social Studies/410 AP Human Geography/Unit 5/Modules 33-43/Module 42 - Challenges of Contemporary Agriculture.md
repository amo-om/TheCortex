## Sustainable Agriculture
- Sustainable agriculture refers to a commitment to satisfying human food and textile needs and to enhancing the quality of life for farmers and society as a whole, now and in the future.
- It requires a balance among feeding the growing population, minimizing environmental impacts, and ensuring social [[Flashcards/Health Science/PHS/justice\|justice]].
- It involves all phases of agriculture from soil health and water management to the cultivation of crops and the management of pasture for animals.
## Biotechnology and Genetically Modified Foods
- Biotechnology is transforming agriculture rapidly.
- Commercial production of foods made with genetically modified organisms (GMOs) began in the United States in 1996.
- Over 90 percent of all soybeans, corn, and canola produced in the United States are genetically modified varieties.
- GMOs have resulted in higher crop yields, mostly as a result of reduced crop losses to diseases and insects.
- Critics maintain that GMOs require heavier use of chemicals that are disruptive to ecosystems and toxic to the environment and to humans.
## Aquaculture
- ==Aquaculture is the cultivation and harvesting of aquatic organisms under controlled conditions.==
- It includes **mariculture**, which is the farming of saltwater species such as shrimp, oysters, and marine fish.
- In 2017, global aquaculture production surpassed wild-caught seafood production for the first time.
- Some researchers say that the expansion of aquaculture comes with high costs to the environment and human health.
## Urban Farming
- Urban farming is the practice of growing fruits and vegetables on small private plots or shared community gardens within the confines of a city.
- It is an intensive farming system that can be oriented toward subsistence or commercial production.
## Community-Supported Agriculture
- Community-supported agriculture (CSA) is a direct-to-consumer marketing arrangement in which farmers are guaranteed buyers for their produce at guaranteed prices and consumers through prepaid subscriptions, receive fresh food directly from the producers.
## Organic Farming
- Organic farming is the production of crops and livestock using ecological processes, natural biodiversity, and renewable resources rather than industrial practices and synthetic inputs.
- The organic food market is now the most rapidly growing and most profitable agricultural sector worldwide.
## Value-Added Specialty Crops and Fair Trade
- A value-added specialty crop is a crop whose physical state or form has been changed.
- Fair trade is a certification program that supports good crop prices for farmers and environmentally sound farming practices.
## Local Food Movements and Dietary Shifts
- Local food movements and dietary shifts are becoming more prevalent as consumers become more conscious of the environmental and health impacts of their food choices.
## Food Deserts
- Food deserts are areas where access to affordable, healthy food options is limited or nonexistent due to the absence of grocery stores within convenient traveling distance.
	- Low income neighbourhoods
	- Rural Areas
## Food Insecurity
- Food insecurity refers to the state of being without reliable access to a sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritious food.
## Food Safety
- Food safety involves handling, preparing, and storing food in a way to best reduce the risk of individuals becoming sick from foodborne illnesses.
## Climate Change
- Climate change poses significant challenges to agriculture, including changes in precipitation patterns, more frequent droughts, and increased heatwaves.
## Food Distribution Systems
- Food distribution systems refer to the network of resources and processes involved in moving food from producers to consumers. Food is often not distributed evenly causing certain areas to have many malnourished people.
## [[Suburbanization\|Suburbanization]]
- [[Suburbanization\|Suburbanization]] can lead to the loss of agricultural land, posing challenges to local food production.
## Economies of Scale in Food Production and Distribution
- Economies of scale refer to the cost advantages that large agribusinesses gain due to their size, output, or scale of operation.
- Large agribusinesses manage the worldwide complexities of food production and distribution.
