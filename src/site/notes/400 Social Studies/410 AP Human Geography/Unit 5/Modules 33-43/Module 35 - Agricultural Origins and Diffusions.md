## Plant and Animal Domestication
   Agriculture started with domestication. A long process which involves selective breeding, protection, and care of plants and animals taken from the wild. This process creates genetically distinct species called domesticates. Domestication is a gradual, constant process resulting from thousands of years of close association between hunter-gatherers and the natural environment.
   - *Trial and Error*: Domestication is not a singular event but a continuous trial-and-error process.
   - *Association with Environment*: Hunter-gatherers learned to control fire, perfect tools, and establish more reliable food sources over thousands of years.
   - *First Agricultural Revolution*: The culmination of these advances led to the domestication of plants and animals, marking the First Agricultural Revolution.
### **Plant Domestication**
   Understanding the process involves recognizing the deliberate planting, protection, and care of plants. Teosinte, a wild grass native to Mexico, exemplifies the plant domestication process. 
   - *Teosinte Domestication*: Early people in Mesoamerica initiated domestication with teosinte, evolving it into modern corn through selective breeding.
   - *Selective Breeding*: Domesticates are genetically distinct due to selective breeding, resulting in larger and more abundant produce.
   - *Role of Women*: Women in hunter-gatherer societies likely played a significant role in early plant domestication.

3. **Geographic Aspects of Plant Domestication**
   Carl Sauer proposed that domestication independently developed at various times and locations, diffusing[^1] outward. 
   - *Sedentary Lifestyle*: Sauer argued that domestication occurred among settled, not migratory, groups with enough food to experiment.
   - *Unsuitable Regions*: Domestication likely avoided grasslands or large river floodplains due to difficulties in working with thick sod and coping with periodic floodwaters.
   - *Biodiverse Regions*: Original domestication areas were likely in regions of great biodiversity, providing ample material for experimentation.
4. **Animal Domestication**
   Domesticated animals, dependent on humans for food and shelter, underwent significant changes from their wild ancestors. The process, except for the dog, likely followed plant domestication.
   - *Mutually Beneficial Interaction*: Recent theories suggest that animals actively sought contact with humans, fostering mutually beneficial interactions.
   - *Important Domesticates*: While various animals were domesticated, only cows, sheep, goats, pigs, and horses achieved global importance.
5. **Hearths of Domestication**
   Identifying early hearths of plant and animal domestication is crucial. Archaeological research points to four subregions: Southwest Asia, China, South and Southeast Asia, Malaysia, Africa, and the Americas.
   - *Southwest Asia*: A major center for plant and animal domestication around 10,000 years ago, giving rise to cereal grains and major herd animals.
   - *Fertile Crescent*: Origin of grains like wheat, barley, rye, oats, and the domestication of grapes, apples, and olives.
   - *Indus River Valley*: Contributed to the domestication of plants, especially dry rice and wheat, and herd animals.
   - *China, South and Southeast Asia, Malaysia*: Independent domestication of crops and animals, including rice, soybeans, sugarcane, bananas, taro, water buffalo, and pigs.
   - *Africa*: Gave rise to peanuts, yams, coffee, barley, wheat, rice, sorghum, and a possible third [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Hearth\|Hearth]] for cattle domestication.
   - *The Americas*: Mesoamerica, a crucial center for maize, tomatoes, beans, and squash domestication; South America domesticated llama, alpaca, guinea pig, and Muscovy duck.
6. **Diffusion of Domesticated plants and Animals**
   The spread of domesticates occurred primarily through expansion diffusion, where traders facilitated their movement. The Columbian Exchange in the 15th and 16th centuries intensified global diffusion.
   - *[[Expansion Diffusion\|Expansion Diffusion]]*: Domesticates spread through traders and interactions, reaching Eurasia and Africa.
   - *[[Columbian Exchange\|Columbian Exchange]]*: Interaction and transfer of plants, animals, culture, technology, disease, and ideas between the Americas, West Africa, and the Old World.
   - *[[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Relocation Diffusion\|Relocation Diffusion]]*: Agricultural products and practices were carried across oceans by explorers, impacting regions through the transfer of ideas.
   - *Modern Diffusions*[^1]: Ongoing diffusion of crops, animals, and innovations across the globe, contributing to multidirectional exchanges.
7. **Impact of Diffusion**
   - *Cultural Exchange*: Diffusion led to cultural exchange, altering diets, practices, and landscapes globally.
   - *Unintended Consequences*: Introduction of new crops, like potatoes in [[Europe\|Europe]], led to unintended consequences, such as the Irish Potato Famine in the 19th century.
   - *Continued Global Diffusion*: Agricultural diffusion, rooted in the First Agricultural Revolution, laid the foundation for subsequent agricultural transformations.
