## Agricultural Production

### Subsistence Agricultural Production Regions
- [[Subsistence agriculture\|Subsistence agriculture]] is food production mainly for consumption by the farming family and local community, rather than principally for sale in the market.
- Subsistence agricultural practices predominate in regions that are less economically developed, such as Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia, East Asia, and Latin America.
### Commercial Agricultural Production Regions
- The primary aim of commercial agriculture is profit maximization.
- Commercial agricultural farmers produce crops for off-farm sales rather than personal consumption.
- Many commercial farms are large, with hired laborers and high capital expenditures.
- Regions with commercial agricultural practices are located in the developed world.
## Bid-Rent Theory
- Bid-rent theory explains how the demand for and price of land decreases as its distance from the [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 6/Central Business District\|central business district]] increases.
- Different land users will compete with one another for land close to the city center.
- ==Intensive agricultural practices such as market gardening and dairy farming are willing to purchase land that is closer to the market at a higher cost per acre because their products are perishable and do not travel well.==
- Extensive agricultural practices such as potato farming often require large areas to plant and harvest the crop. These farms are located farther from the market, where the land is less expensive and more available.
## Large-Scale Commercial Operations
- Large-scale commercial operations practice [[monocropping\|monocropping]]([[monoculture\|monoculture]]), producing one crop, such as wheat, on extensive tracts of land.
- These operations are owned by a family, nonfamily corporations, or cooperatives that are run by member farmers.
## Family Farms
- A family farm is a farming operation majority-owned by a family or family corporation that sells its products to some defined market, either directly or through a cooperative.
- The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA/ERS) classifies family farms by gross annual sales: Small (gross cash farm income (GCFI) less than $350,000), Midsize (GCFI between $350,000 and $999,999), Large (GCFI between $1,000,000 and $4,999,999), Very large (GCFI of $5,000,000 or more).
## Family-Held Farms and Large-Scale Commercial Operations
- The number of family-held dairy farms in the United States has dropped from its peak in 1935.
- The decline of family dairy farms reflects the pattern in the United States for all family-held farms in that production has shifted to larger farms.
- Production has been shifting to larger farms for many years. Family and nonfamily farms with $1 million in annual gross cash farm income (GCFI) accounted for half of the value of U.S. farm production in 2015, up from about a third in 1991.
## Commodity Chains
- ==In agriculture, a commodity is a primary product that can be bought and sold, such as chicken, coffee, rice, or milk.==
- A commodity chain is a series of links connecting a commodity’s places of production, distribution, and consumption.
- Each link along the chain adds value to the commodity, producing differing levels of profit for the place and the people where production occurs.
## Poultry Production
- Over the past half century, poultry farming has fundamentally changed, and it now operates along the commodity chain.
- The farmer signs a contract with an agribusiness, a large corporation that provides a vast array of goods and services to support the agriculture industry.
## Industrial Inputs
- Pesticides and synthetic fertilizers, developed in the 20th century, are majour in conventional agriculture.
- The Green Revolution increased farmers' reliance on industrial inputs such as synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides.
- Artificial fertilizers stimulate crop growth, and pesticides reduce crop losses, leading to major increases in yields per acre of many crops.
- This has increased the carrying capacity of the available agricultural land and the profits of large commercial farms due to economies of scale.
- Farmers now rely on concentrated feeds and synthesized vitamins, hormones, vaccines, and antibiotics for livestock.
- Concentrated feed reduces the need for extensive areas needed to feed the animals and allows for confined feeding, which some consider cruel.
- Hormones stimulate animals' growth rates and boost the efficiency with which they convert feed into meat, shortening production time.
- Vaccines and antibiotics are needed to combat the spread of diseases in closely confined animals.
- These industrial inputs have reduced the need for extensive grazing areas, thus increasing the agricultural carrying capacity as more animals are raised in a smaller area.
## Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation (CAFO)
- A CAFO is an animal rearing system that confines livestock in high-density cages only large enough to allow the animal’s body to grow and to accommodate equipment for feeding and waste removal.
- Technology and the industrialisation of the livestock sector have increased economies of scale as farmers raise more animals in a shorter time frame and in less space.
## [[Mechanization\|Mechanization]]
- ==Nearly every part of the agricultural production process, from field preparation to harvesting, is now mechanized.==
- Industrialized farms are dependent on [[fossil fuels\|fossil fuels]] to run the cultivators and harvesters, pump the irrigation water, heat the buildings, and more.
- Machinery is growing ever more sophisticated and expensive, incorporating computer systems, lasers (for guiding plows and field leveling), drones (for soil and field analysis), and GPS.
- Greater [[mechanization\|mechanization]] has greatly increased labor productivity, meaning fewer year-round workers are needed in the fields.
## Cool Chains
- A cool chain is a system that uses refrigeration and food-freezing technologies to keep farm produce fresh in climate-controlled environments at every stage of transport from field to retail grocers and restaurants.
- Cool chains are the backbone of a food system that allows low-weight, high-value agricultural products to be flown to any major city in the world and sold fresh to shoppers less than 48 hours after harvest.
## Global Food System
- The global food system is the result of a decades-long trend of commercialization, industrialisation, and new technologies that have increased agricultural carrying capacity through increased productivity and economies of scale.
- The industrial model of food production and distribution developed largely in the United States and is now commonplace worldwide.
