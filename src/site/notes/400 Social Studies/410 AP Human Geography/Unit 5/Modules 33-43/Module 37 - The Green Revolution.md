>Green Revolution is aka the third agricultural revolution 
## Downsides of Irrigation
- Two significant downsides to irrigation are soil salinity and groundwater depletion.
  - Soil salinization is the **concentration of dissolved salts in the soil, resulting from poor irrigation practices in areas with poor drainage.**
  - *High soil salinity is toxic to most plants and soil organisms, affecting land productivity.*
  - ==Groundwater depletion is caused by the large volume of water required for Green Revolution irrigation==, leading to a **severe decrease in groundwater in irrigated areas,** raising concerns about water scarcity.
## Development and Use of High-Yield Seeds
- **The Green Revolution refers to the US-supported development of high-yield seed varieties and agricultural technologies for use in less developed countries.**
- It was **built on scientific advances in plant breeding, synthetic fertilizers, and chemical pesticides, bringing larger harvests to subsistence farmers.**
- **The three primary characteristics** of the Green Revolution are the ==development and use of high-yield seeds, increased use of synthetic fertilizers and chemical pesticides, and increased irrigation and mechanization.==
## Increased Use of Synthetic Fertilizers and Chemical Pesticides
- The Green Revolution brought the development of *high-yield seed varieties, requiring large amounts of synthetic fertilizers and chemical pesticides to meet their yield potential.*
- This led to larger harvests but tied the farmer to greatly increased expenses for hybrid seeds, synthetic fertilizers, chemical pesticides, an irrigation [[infrastructure\|infrastructure]], and mechanized farm equipment.
## Irrigation and Mechanization
- Irrigation infrastructure is essential for high crop yields made possible by Green Revolution technology.
- Paddy rice farming is an example of the development of irrigation methods, which required flooded paddies for the growth of seedlings to maturity and harvest.
- Irrigation projects included regional dam construction, piped water, irrigation pumps, and mechanical dikes to villages and individual farmers, leading to double-cropping in many areas.
## Increased Crop Productivity
- The Green Revolution led to increased crop productivity, decreased world hunger, and more efficient use of agricultural land.
- Overall rice production in [[Asia\|Asia]] grew 66 percent between 1965 and 1985 due to the innovations of the Green Revolution.
## Expense of Seed, Fertilizer, and Mechanization
- The negative effects of the Green Revolution include the cost of seed, fertilizer, and mechanization, loss of subsistence farming, plant diversity, genetic variety, food security, and a widening gap between rich and poor farmers.
