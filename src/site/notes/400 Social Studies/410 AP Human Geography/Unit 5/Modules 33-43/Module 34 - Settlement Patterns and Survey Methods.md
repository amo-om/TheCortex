## [[Intensive Agriculture\|Intensive Agricultural Practices]] and the Rural Landscape
- Agricultural landscapes, which cover 33.3% of the world's land area, are the visible imprints of agricultural practices, such as rice paddies, barns, or feedlots.
- These landscapes can vary over short distances, reflecting local agricultural practices.
- Different types of farming practices create distinctive agricultural landscapes.
### [[Market Gardening\|Market Gardening]] and Truck Farming
- The landscape for market gardening and truck farming depends on the type of product raised, the climate, and the market where the products are sold.
- In areas where markets are regional or global, the landscape is characterized by open level fields or orchards where vegetables or orchard crops are the primary crops.
### [[Plantations\|Plantations]] 
- Plantations are typically located in vast, relatively flat areas near coastal regions, laid out in linear patterns for ease of cultivation and harvesting.
- The landscape associated with plantation farming is characterized by cleared and cultivated areas in the tropics and subtropics for crops such as sugar, tea, coffee, bananas, and oil palm.
### [[Mixed Crop-Livestock Farming\|Mixed Crop-Livestock Farming]]
- Mixed crop/livestock farming takes place around small villages where families live at the edges of the fields.
- The agricultural landscape in regions with mixed crop/livestock farming shows a small, tightly clustered village surrounded by fields.
### Paddy Rice Farming
- The agricultural landscape for paddy rice farming is diked, flooded rice paddies, some of which are placed on top of terraced hillsides.
### Grain Farming
- The agricultural landscape for grain farming is distinguished by vast fields of grain that can cover hundreds of acres.
- The most obvious structures in the grain belt are the grain elevators that store grains.
### Livestock Fattening
- Large feedlots in which beef cattle are raised for meat are physical evidence of livestock fattening operations.
- The landscape includes slaughterhouses and corn and soybean fields where food for the animals is grown.
### Dairy Farming
- The landscapes of dairy farming differ depending on the practice.
	- The landscape for the traditional family dairy farm includes the home, barns, and other outbuildings, plus fenced pastures and fields for crops.
	- In feedlot dairy operations, there are large buildings for shelter and perhaps a separate milking parlor, or barn, where cows are milked.
## [[Extensive Agriculture\|Extensive Agricultural Practices]] and the Rural Landscape
- The agricultural landscapes of extensive agricultural practices are less visible than the landscapes for intensive agricultural practices.
### [[Shifting Cultivation\|Shifting Cultivation]]
- The agricultural landscape of the tropical areas in which shifting cultivation is practiced is composed of clearings that show a mix of active, newly abandoned, long abandoned, and newly cleared areas throughout a broad area surrounding each village.
### [[Nomadic Herding\|Nomadic Herding]]
- Because mobility is key to nomadic herders, nomadic herding leaves less of a permanent imprint on the landscape.
- The basic needs for the family and animals, such as tents and pens, are limited and moved from place to place along with the herds.
### [[Livestock Ranching\|Livestock Ranching]]
- The landscapes of livestock ranching include an open range, permanent dwellings, and small buildings for ranch workers and storage.
## Rural Settlement Patterns
- Rural settlement patterns are the ways in which people organize themselves on the land.
- There are three primary rural settlement patterns: clustered, dispersed, and linear.
### Clustered Settlements
- In many parts of the world, farmers group together in clustered settlements, also known as farm villages.
- These tightly bunched settlements have anywhere from a few dozen to several hundred inhabitants.
### Dispersed Settlements
- The dispersed or isolated settlement pattern, in which families live relatively distant from one another, is less common than the clustered farm village.
- A relatively recent form of settlement, it developed during the European colonization of new farmland in Anglo America, [[Australia\|Australia]], New Zealand, and South Africa.
### Linear Settlements
- In a linear settlement pattern, buildings are arranged in a line, often along a road or river.
- This pattern is limited to areas where legal systems dictated that property lines must be rectangular.
## Survey Methods
- Most countries have some form of cadastral survey, a systematic documentation of property ownership, shape, use, and boundaries.
- There are regional differences in survey methods that result in specific patterns.
### [[Metes & Bounds\|Metes & Bounds]]
- The metes and bounds survey system uses natural features such as trees, boulders, and streams to delineate property boundaries.
- As a result, farms surveyed under the metes and bounds system are much more varied in outline than those in which rectangular surveying was used.
### [[Township & Range\|Township & Range]]
- A survey system created by the U.S. Land Ordinance of 1785.
- It divides the country into a grid of 6 mi. by 6 mi. squares.
	- Each of these townships were divided into 36 sections, 1 square mile each.
- It is known as the “brainchild” of Thomas Jefferson, and used across the Midwest and West.
### Long Lot
- A unit-block survey system like [[Township & Range\|Township & Range]], whose basic unit is a rectangle, usually 10 times longer than wide
- Long Lot makes a pattern that allows farmers to get equal/easy access to fertile land, water, and access to transportation.
- Appeared lots in colonial America.
