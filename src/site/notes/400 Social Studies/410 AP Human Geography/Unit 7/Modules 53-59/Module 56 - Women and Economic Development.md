# Family Life
>Economic development changes women’s roles in society in profound ways. From whether, when, and whom they marry to new freedom of movement to new education opportunities, women’s lives are deeply affected.
- Society has always favoured men over women for many cultural reasons, but as they develop, preferential treatment towards mean decreases and women become more equal with them
## Female Education
- Male children are favoured because parents think that the sons will gain more money, so they can help the family more
	- Families also invest more in males because more education = higher income
- Economic growth increases job opportunities for everyone, so families may reconsider their investment choices
- There is a close correlation between economic growth & girls' education rates
	- Better economy → Girls stay in school longer
	- Global secondary education rates for girls has been increasing in the 21st century
	- In developed countries females are enrolling in college more than men
## Delayed Marriage & Declining Fertility Rates
- Higher education for girls led to delayed marriage and lower rates of adolescent childbearing (busy with college)
	- Theres also a link between economic growth and declining fertility rates
- Economic growth has made girls' roles in families more like boys'
	- Education and post-education employment ([[formal sector\|formal sector]])is expected from girls now
	- And expectations to be wives and mothers has decreased because of economic growth
# Public Life
>We can identify a consistent pattern of spatially assigned gender roles. Women are primarily assigned to private, domestic spaces (the household scale), while men are primarily assigned to public spaces (the local, regional, and global scales).
- As economies progress, women's roles expand in society, giving them more access to more participation in public life
## Geographic Mobility
>Geographic mobility, one’s relative ability to move through space, is a key measure of individual liberty and privilege. Like many liberties and privileges, women and men experience geographic mobility unevenly. Economic development significantly increases women’s freedom to move about as they become more active in school, employment, and the public sphere.
- Women's higher education and formal workforce participation increased their geographical mobility
	- Especially due to the expansion of the service sector in the mid-20th century
- In [[China\|China]] and [[Mexico\|Mexico]] the manufacturing sector has given young women jobs in the electronics industry
- Electric appliances (dishwasher, washing machine, etc.) have allowed women to not have to do housework as much
## Empowerment and Political Participation
- Higher education rates = more civics participation for women
- A way to calculate women in civics is to figure out the percentage that hold a governmental seats
	- Because it's so simple it misses other forms of public/political engagement
- The [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/United Nations\|UN]] came up with the [[Gender Empowerment Measure\|Gender Empowerment Measure]] to solve siad problems, GEM also measures the percent of women in economic decision  making positions like admin, and the amount of women's shared income vs. men's
# Devaluing Women's Labor
- Although women are now more common in the workforce, many jobs are still split into "men's work" & "women's work"
	- "Women's work" pays less
	- "Women's work" includes unpaid home labor, such work pushes women to gain a job in the informal sector (more flexible) but labor & wages are lower compared the formal sector
	- Women also make up the agricultural workforce in the first stages of development 
	- Countries with a high GDP per capita have women working in professional jobs, vice versa for low GDP per capita
		- Medium GDP has the lowest female participation rates
# “Men’s Work” and “Women’s Work”
- In the 19th century working in the office was considered mens work, but now it's womens work
	- But in [[India\|India]] it is still considered mens work
	- Gender Divisions in work are often done through law
- The first wave of [[the industrial revolution\|the industrial revolution]] jobs was mens jobs
	- Women weren't seen as strong enough
- After WW2 women worked to replace the men in factories who got deployed
	- Manufacturing jobs in developing countries are still considered womens work
		- These jobs keep gender gaps as thw wage is low, and there is practically no job security 
- In the world's 500 largest companies only 5% are lead by women
# Wage Disparity
- By gender coding jobs, males often earn more money even if he females are working a male-coded job
	- Gender pay gap is uneven across the world, developing countries have a much larger pay gap compared to developed countries 
		- North Africa & The Middle East have the largest pay gaps

# Microloans as Economic Development Strategy
- In developing countries, women don't have access to banks as much as men do, they also own less property so they aren't able to gain loans
	- They are the poorest of the poor
- Microloans are small loans given to people with low income to help them build a small business
	- They are as small as $150 and help women buy tools & supplies to start a business 
	- Muhammad Yunus was able to get the most successes in Bangladesh
# The Limits of Microloans
- Although [[microloans\|microloans]] are extremely helpful, some people fail to start a business and sink further into debt
