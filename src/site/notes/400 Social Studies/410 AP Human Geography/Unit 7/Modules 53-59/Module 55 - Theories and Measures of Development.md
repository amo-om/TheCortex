# [[Rostow’s Stages of Economic Growth\|Rostow’s Stages of Economic Growth]]
>The concept of economic development has a relatively short history. It emerged after World War II over concern about low living standards in many world regions. Subsequently, scholars established theories to explain why certain countries have or have not developed.
- Rostow made one of the earliest and most influential models of economic development
- He assumed that every country will go through the same 5 stages
- His model faces criticism because it suggests that countries develop in isolation
	- Wrong because our world is interconnected and a primary sector country may supply to a secondary sector country
- It also assumes that there will be no obstacles from other countries
# [[Wallerstein’s World Systems Theory\|Wallerstein’s World Systems Theory]]
> World systems theory regards world history as moving through a series of socioeconomic systems, culminating in the modern world system by about the year 1900. The modern world system is our current interdependent, capitalist world economy rooted in nation-state economies.
- The world systems theory is based on the Core-Periphery-Semi-Periphery model[^1]
	- Core countries industrialised first
		- Western Europe, [[North America\|North America]], [[Japan\|Japan]]
		- Have the complex manufacturing systems, and highest levels of consumption
	- The periphery is made up of mainly agricultural and extraction based countries, with low consumption
	- The semi-periphery is the middle-ground, they mediate politically & economically between the core and periphery
- World systems theory suggests that countries don't go through a set of development stages, instead are incorporated into the world economy by imperialism & colonialism
	- causing unequal development patterns
- The world systems theory is based on the [[international division of labor\|international division of labor]], where the periphery is mainly the primary sector
- Core is tertiary & above
- Semi-periphery is in-between
- It also acknowledges that countries can shift to any of these phases, forwards or backwards
- It also says that countries with high mass consumption exploited the cheap resourced in less-developed countries
	- They underdeveloped the world to maintain their position
- It's criticised because of it's [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Misc./Global Scale\|global scale]] of analysis
	- Which doesn't detail the complexities at the regional & [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Misc./City Scale\|local scale]]
# [[Dependency Theory\|Dependency Theory]]
>World systems theory builds on earlier dependency theory, which emerged from economists’ observations of South American economies. Scholars had become disillusioned by the failures of the developing countries of [[South America\|South America]] to move out of poverty and transform into “modern,” developed economies. The theory was soon applied to other world regions that had similarly failed to grow economically.
- Dependency theory focuses on the core & periphery, it says that the reason why poverty isn't gone isn't because of periphery countries, it's because core countries exploit them by forcing the periphery to be dependent on them
	- [[Colonialism\|Colonialism]] & [[Imperialism\|Imperialism]]
- It focused on how the core used the periphery as a raw material supplier, inhibiting economic growth
- But now it focuses on the profits being made in periphery countries, saying it's being siphoned to core countries
- They propose for periphery countries to delink and remove trade relationships from the core
- It's been criticised for pay too little attentions to the social & cultural patterns in the periphery & core that may also explain uneven development
- Delinking is also hard to do because the economy now is extremely interdependent
# [[Commodity Dependence\|Commodity Dependence]]
>Commodity dependence occurs when commodities account for more than 60 percent of the value of a country’s total exports
- Poorer countries tend to rely on their exports to make money, which means commodity dependence is linked to underdevelopment
# Measures of Economic Growth
>To identify a country’s level of development, it is often helpful to measure the size of the country’s economy. Common measures include gross national product, gross domestic product, and gross national income.
# Gross National Product (GNP)
- GNP measures the total value of all goods & services made by a countrys residents, regardless of where it was made
- GNP does not count foreign residents or businesses
	- If I made money in [[Ghana\|Ghana]], it'd count for America
# Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
- Measures the value of all goods and services in a country no matter the producers origin
	- If I made money in [[Ghana\|Ghana]] it'd count for it's GDP not GNP
- Better for gauging economic health

{ #5cdc70}

# [[Gross National Income\|Gross National Income]] ([[Gross National Income\|GNI]])
- Gross national income is used to measure total income of a country's residents & businesses, regardless of where it was earned, including money gotten from other countries
	- GNI is more accurate measure of economic health for countries that gain lots of foreign aid & investment (Developing Countries)
	- It's more accurate as it counts available income in a national economy which GDP fails to account 
## Refining Gross Economic Measures
- [[400 Social Studies/410 AP Human Geography/Unit 7/Modules 53-59/Module 55 - Theories and Measures of Development#^5cdc70\|The map above]] shows the large gaps in GDP from country to country as all it shows is what countries produce more goods & services than other countries
	- [[Brazil\|Brazil]] has the 9th largest GDP in the world, yet the average Brazilian is not 9x richer than the average New Zealander
		- This is because [[New Zealand\|New Zealand]] has only 2% of the population of [[Brazil\|Brazil]] so they don't make us much goods & services
- [[GDP per capita\|GDP per capita]] is a country's GDP divided by its population
	- It shows how rich or poor the average citizen of said country is
		- [[New Zealand\|New Zealand's]] [[GDP per capita \|GDP per capita ]] is $41,966 (2018), while [[Brazil\|Brazil's]] was $8,920
![GDP per Capita.png](/img/user/Files/GDP%20per%20Capita.png)
>Another problem with GDP & GNP is that they don't account for differences in currency value from one country to the next
- That's why economists made the [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 7/Purchasing Power Parity\|purchasing power parity]]([[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 7/Purchasing Power Parity\|PPP]]) theory
- [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 7/Purchasing Power Parity\|PPP]] measures how much a normal "basket of goods" costs locally
	>- It begins with a set of commonly bought items and then uses currency exchange rates to compare the price of the basket in different locations
- [[Switzerland\|Switzerland]] has a higher [[GDP per capita\|GDP per capita]] than [[Australia\|Australia]], so we can assume its citizens are richer
	- If an average pair of women's shoes is $60 in [[Switzerland\|Switzerland]] and $20 in [[Australia\|Australia]], we can say Australians can buy 3 times more shoes compared to the Swiss
		- So they have a higher [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 7/Purchasing Power Parity\|PPP]] (more bang for their buck)
		- [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 7/Purchasing Power Parity\|PPP]] also implies that [[Australia\|Australia]]'s citizens are richer than [[Switzerland\|Switzerland]]'s
		- A limitation is that is simplifies complex national economies
# Measures of Social Development
>Without sufficient economic resources, societies are unable to provide for their citizens. Recognising the need to consider quality-of-life issues, development specialists have devised various measures of social development.
## [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 7/Gender Inequality Index\|Gender Inequality Index]] ([[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 7/Gender Inequality Index\|GII]])
- The [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 7/Gender Inequality Index\|Gender Inequality Index]] is a measure of gender inequality based on reproductive health, empowerment, and labor-market participation
	- Reproductive health is measured by maternal mortality ratios & adolescent birth rates
	- Empowerment is based upon the percentage of government seats taken by women & the amount of females & males over 25 with secondary education
	- The labor-market participation is based on the amount of male & females over 25 in the workforce
- [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 7/Gender Inequality Index\|GII]] has revealed gender inequalities and has caused policy debates
- [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 7/Gender Inequality Index\|GII]] doesn't completely capture all of gender inequality
	- Empowerment only measures national government participation
		- It doesn't represent day to day people
	- Labor-market participation doesn't consider the quality of jobs of women vs. men
		- It also doesn't count for unpaid labor, which fall a lot on women (caregiving, housekeeping)
## [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 7/Human Development Index\|Human Development Index]] ([[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 7/Human Development Index\|HDI]])
- The World Bank created the [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 7/Human Development Index\|HDI]] to measure non-economical aspects of human life
	- It combines [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 2/Life Expectancy\|Life Expectancy]], education levels, & GNI per capita ([[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 7/Purchasing Power Parity\|PPP]])
- Two countries with the same GNI per capita may have different [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 7/Human Development Index\|HDI]]s
- Although it was very revolutionary in measuring development levels of countries around the world, it doesn't capture QoL factors such as feelings of security or sense of self
	- It also doesn't say much about poverty, inequalities between religions & ethnicities & genders
# Other Development Measures and Considerations
>National economies and societies are highly complex, and the meaning of development continues to evolve.
## Formal & Informal Economic Sectors
- The informal sector is the part of an economy not officially recorded or taxed by the government
	- Babysitting, Yard Work, etc.
- Some countries have large informal sectors almost as big as the formal sector
	- It gains its workforce from people with little education/formal training
		- Women make up most of the sector as women are often discriminated in the formal sector
- Because its not recorded its not included in [[Gross Domestic Product\|GDP]], GNP, or GNI
	- A country's economic activity may be underestimated
	- Since it isn't taxed the government doesn't get money to build [[infrastructure\|infrastructure]] 
## Income Distribution
>However, per capita measures do not reveal income distribution. Income distribution refers to how a country’s total GDP is distributed among the individuals in its population. This is one way to assess economic inequality within countries.
## Access to Health Care
- Its hard to measure how people fell about their lives and their opportunities for self fulfilment
	- These depend on culture & history and are different for every person
- Healthcare can be used as a measure of well-being
	- It can include reproductive, maternal, newborn, child health, rate of disease
		- Reproductive health includes fertility rates
		- Newborn health measures [[infant mortality rate\|infant mortality rate]]
	- Access to healthcare is measured by affordability & availability
## Fossil Fuel Use and Renewable Energy
- Measuring development can be done through the link between economic growth and energy consumption
	- In [[the industrial revolution\|the industrial revolution]] [[fossil fuels\|fossil fuel]] use spiked as machines became more common
		- The first industrialized countries had the advantage of domestic resources & resources gained through [[Imperialism\|Imperialism]]
		- ==Fossil Fuel use → Economic Growth==
	- Developing countries face different circumstances
		- Some don't have domestic [[fossil fuels\|fossil fuels]], so they need to use their money to but them from other countries
			- Stifling economic development 
		- Developing countries that do have a domestic source of [[fossil fuels\|fossil fuels]] are in a better position, but often have to pay other countries to help with extraction & refining
- [[fossil fuels\|fossil fuels]] have been shown to cause higher greenhouse gases
- Its also been shown that renewable energy sources contribute to economic development
	- For countries who don't have domestic [[fossil fuels\|fossil fuels]], renewable energy decreases the cost of importing fuel
	- Renewable energy also helps the economy of a country grow
