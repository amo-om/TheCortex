# Economic Sectors
>Economic sectors are groupings of industries based on what is produced and the activities of the workforce.
## [[Primary Sector\|Primary Sector]]
- Industries that extract [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 1/Natural Resources\|natural resources]](renewable & non-renewable)
	- Fishing
	- Hunting 
	- Farming 
	- Logging
	- Oil extraction
	- Quarrying
	- Mining
## [[Secondary Sector\|Secondary Sector]]
- Processes raw material into usable items(factory workers)
	- Ore → Steel
	- Logs → Lumber
	- Fish → Canned
## [[Tertiary Sector\|Tertiary Sector]]
- Provides services to businesses and consumers, including delivery & transportation
	- Checkout Clerks
	- Lawyers
	- Professors/Teachers
## [[Quaternary Sector\|Quaternary Sector]]
- Industries that focus on collecting and using information, innovation & invention
	- Scientists & research
	- Computer Programmer & software development
## [[Quinary Sector\|Quinary Sector]] 
- Highest level of management & information use in business, government, science, & education
	- Has a global impact
	- CEO's
	- Presidents
# Patterns of Economic Development
>The organization of economic sectors implies a hierarchy of economic development. 
- The most common type of sector in a country can tell you it's type of development
	- Mostly [[Primary Sector\|Primary Sector]] = least developed, and so on and so forth
## National Economic Core Areas
>Patterns of geographically uneven development arose within national economies as [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Industrialisation\|Industrialisation]] progressed. The steelmaking industry provides a good illustration.
- Industrial regions have many zones
	- The Core is where manufacturing happens
	- The periphery are the natural resource sources
	- This happens because it gives industries advantages
		- Being close to coalfields as a steelmaking industry
- A Base Industry is an industry with a large economical importance compared to other who depend on it(steel is the base industry in this example)
	- The steel industry attracts other ones in the secondary & tertiary sector to the core area
		- Industries that provide steelmaking areas with supplies
		- Specialized services
	- Which then causes other industries that need steel to form nearby
		- Car Factory
	- Then the movement of people into the area causes more economic growth in housing, retail, infrastructure, schools, etc.
## Global Economic [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/Core States\|Core States]]
- The Core-Periphery model applies globally also
	- The British controlled the manufacturing of textiles (by restricting the diffusion of the technology), but couldn't get the raw material input (cotton) in it's borders
	- So it took over Egypt & India, payed workers very little to collect cotton, and managed to gain a monopoly over the cotton business
		- Became a [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/Core States\|Core State]] 
	- Ultimately, causing Egypt & India to become [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Periphery States\|peripheral states]] 
		- Most of their workforce was in the [[Primary Sector\|Primary Sector]] 
	- This can be applied to many places around the world, and it's effects show uneven development
- In the late 20th century(1950s → 2000), a new category of [[Nation-States\|Nation-States]] came
	- [[Semi-Periphery States\|Semi-Periphery States]] are made up of countries whose economy are similar to the core & periphery
	- These countries were former colonies, leaving the periphery stage, gaining a larger [[Secondary Sector\|secondary]] & [[tertiary sector\|tertiary sector]]
		- [[Mexico\|Mexico]]
		- [[Brazil\|Brazil]]
		- [[India\|India]]

# Common Factors Influencing Manufacturing Location
>The uneven distribution of industrial manufacturing across the globe reflects the many factors that influence the location of manufacturing.
# Energy
- Every manufacturing process needs energy
	- Early aluminium plants used lots of electricity, so they were located near hydroelectric facilities (Niagara Falls)
## Materials
- Good access to materials is a necessity for industrial locations
	- I.e. break-of-bulk points
		- A place in which large amounts of unpackaged goods, is transferred from one transportation to another
	- If a manufacturer is at a break-of-bulk point, transfer costs are lowered as loading & unloading is expensive
## Labour
- Companies often locate in areas with low wages to reduce costs
	- They also move to places with low education & high unemployment 
- The American center for textile manufacturing moved from the northeastern states(high wage) to the low wage south
## Markets
- Manufacturing is located near their consumers so they can reduce transport costs to maximize profits
## Transportation
- Transportation access is the most important factor in determining a business' location
	- 1/3 of goods are shipped by air
- Shipping containers have allowed for greater efficiency in shipping as ships, trucks, & trains have been designed to hold them
	- 90% of non-bulk cargo is transported in containers

>- Containerization, the system of intermodal freight transport using shipping containers, is a simple technology that altered the logic of manufacturing location. It allowed firms to move manufacturing to [[Flashcards/Health Science/PHS/Peripheral\|peripheral]] economies, helping to give rise to the semi-periphery.
# Location Theory
>Usually, two or more potential manufacturing locations will have different sets of advantages and disadvantages. Business managers must weigh these differences carefully in order to make the best decision.
## [[Least-Cost Theory\|Least-Cost Theory]]
>One of the earliest and best-known theories of manufacturing location is Alfred Weber’s least-cost theory. Weber, a German economist, based his theory on his real-life observations of early [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Industrialisation\|Industrialisation]] in [[Europe\|Europe]]. He set out to create a general theory to explain the spatial patterns he saw.
- Weber created ab location triangle, it had two locations for materials sources and one market
- He concluded that manufacturing would be located at the least costing transportation spots
- Distance & Weight were his to key variables
- He then examined the weight of the inputs compared to the manufactured goods, and noticed that transportation costs was the key to location of manufacturing 
- After doing vice versa, he concluded that if the final product was heavier than the inputs, the factory would be closer to the market(bottling plants), and vice versa if the raw materials are heavier than the final product.
- Limiations include
	- It doesn't represent real-world situations
	- It assumes people have perfect knowledge  of all factors
	- And today transportation costs are less important compared to labor, etc.
