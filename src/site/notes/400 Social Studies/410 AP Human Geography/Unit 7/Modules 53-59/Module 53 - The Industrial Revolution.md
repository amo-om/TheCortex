# The Industrial Revolution
>The rapid transformation of the economy through the introduction of machines, new power sources, and new chemical processes in [[Europe\|Europe]] and the United States between 1760 and 1830

 - Before the Industrial Revolution, society and culture was mostly rural and agricultural. 
 - Cities existed—as centers of political power, education, and innovation—but most people lived in the countryside, obtaining their food through [[agriculture\|agriculture]].
## Origins and Preconditions
- **In the early 1700s, conditions in Great Britain provided a perfect jumpstart for the Industrial Revolution.**
	- **Agricultural advancements increased food production and reduced the demand for agricultural workers.**
		- This caused a movement of poor, unemployed people into the cities, giving factories a large labour force to work with
	- **Great Britain’s damp, cool climate was perfect for producing sheep’s wool.**
		- Which was in turn used to increase textile production
			- Great Britain traditionally produced textiles
	- **Great Britain was the world’s trade leader in the eighteenth century.**
		- This was due to it's dominant naval power
		- Large amount of colonies
		- And it's monopolized trade with many parts of the globe
	- **New wealth provided extra money needed to support innovations in industry, transportation, and energy.**
		- New machines and ideas brought investment, allowing for more advances in technology and more improvements in labor productivity

## Early Mechanisation
- **[[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Industrialisation\|Industrialisation]] started in Britain’s textile manufacturing, centered at that the Lancashire district in northwestern England.** 
- Changes started small but slowly grew in impact
	- Craftsmen invented mechanical spinners and looms, and people channeled flowing [[Periodic Table of Elements/And Compounds/Dihydrogen Oxide\|water]] to power the new machines in textile mills. 
	- ==The spinning jenny allowed a single worker to manage multiple looms at a time, increasing productivity and amount of goods produced per worker per unit of time==
	- ![Spinning Jenny Lady.png](/img/user/Files/Spinning%20Jenny%20Lady.png)
	- The Industrial Revolution led to the development of new transportation such as steel vessels by steam engines & railroad.
		- Said systems allowed the diffusion of ideas & practices including the Industrial Revolution
# Diffusion of the Industrial Revolution
- Great Britain maintained a monopoly on the Industrial Revolution into the 1800s.
	- They tried their best to prevent diffusion of their inventions, giving Britain a huge economic advantage
- Technology still diffused in to [[Europe\|Europe]]
	- Second Half of the 19th century(1850-1900), it diffused in to Belgium & Germany and other northwestern/central European countries
	- The US adopted railroads in 1850
	- ==Japan in 1900(aka the first non-western country to go under [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Industrialisation\|Industrialisation]])==
	- Early 20th(1900-1930) [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Industrialisation\|Industrialisation]] spread to Russia & Ukraine
![Diffusion of Industrial Revolution.png](/img/user/Files/Diffusion%20of%20Industrial%20Revolution.png)
# [[Fossil Fuels\|Fossil Fuels]]
> ==**[[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Industrialisation\|Industrialisation]] depends on a steady and reliable source of [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 1/Natural Resources\|natural resources]]**==, which provide power sources and raw material inputs in manufacturing processes.
- In the early parts of the industrial revolution, being close to [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 1/Natural Resources\|natural resources]] was important
	- But innovations in transportation(trains, steamboats, etc.) allowed manufacturing to be further away from resources
- The first stage of [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Industrialisation\|Industrialisation]] had manufacturing areas rural and far apart as they had to be close to power sources(wood & [[Periodic Table of Elements/And Compounds/Dihydrogen Oxide\|water]]) & [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 1/Natural Resources\|natural resources]]
	- Places near [[Periodic Table of Elements/And Compounds/Dihydrogen Oxide\|water]] were perfect for the textile industry as [[Periodic Table of Elements/And Compounds/Dihydrogen Oxide\|water]] was channeled to power looms([[spinning jenny\|spinning jenny]])
	- Charcoal was used for power furnaces in smelting
- Innovations in the mid-1700s improved the steam engine and caused a shift of power supply from wood & [[Periodic Table of Elements/And Compounds/Dihydrogen Oxide\|water]] to coal
>	Fossil fuels are natural fuels derived from the fossilized remains of living organisms. Coal, crude oil, and natural gas are all examples of fossil fuels.
- Coal has more energy than wood and allowed factories & manufacturers to move into cities for better suited labor & transportation
	- As a side effect, they started to cluster([[agglomeration\|agglomeration]])
- Coal is difficult to transport so steelmaking factories clustered around coal fields
	- Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania is located in the middle of multiple coalfields, making it the most productive steelmaking [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 1/Region\|region]] in the world
	- Canals & railroads still allowed coal to be available far from mines, to cut costs companies stayed near coalfields
# Raw Materials Inputs
>[[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 1/Natural Resources\|Natural resources]] give a source of raw materials for manufacturing
- [[Periodic Table of Elements/Iron\|Iron]] Ore → [[Periodic Table of Elements/Iron\|Iron]] → Steel
- Coalfields → Coke → used for furnace fuel and making [[Periodic Table of Elements/Iron\|iron]]
	- Pittsburg's location in the middle of 3 rivers allowed it to gain lots of [[Periodic Table of Elements/Iron\|iron]] ore from the great lakes
- Everything needs a raw resourced to be refined to make things
	- factories needed lumber, stone, sand, brick, clay, & limestone to make
	- Machines were made from steel
# Increased Food Supplies & Population
>The Industrial Revolution transformed individual and social life. Not only did it greatly alter our daily activities, from how and where we obtained our food to how and where we lived, but it also changed our sense of self in relation to the world.
- The innovations leading up to the industrial revolution increased food supplies in England & western Europe
	- Crop Rotation
	- Lots of small fields → Single Big Farms
		- Because new farming machines needed more land to be effective, therefore causing even more productivity
	- More efficient tools & labor
		- [[Periodic Table of Elements/Iron\|Iron]]-tipped plows
	- Fertiliser
	- Steam-powered tractors
- The increased amount of food outgrew population growth
	- But also caused large population growth
	- Great Britian went from 10.8 million in 1801 to 37.1 million in 1901
	- Malnutrition & famines occured due to the bad distribution of food instead of nlack of food
# Rural → [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 6/Urban\|Urban]] [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Misc./Migration\|Migration]]
>The increasing [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Industrialisation\|Industrialisation]] of agriculture pushed rural dwellers off their land. Farmland consolidation and increased productivity through mechanization meant fewer jobs and fewer places to live in rural areas. Rural residents had little choice but to leave. Industrial manufacturing, increasingly consolidated in and around cities, became the destination for uprooted rural dwellers, who could earn money by working in city factories. Urbanization accelerated dramatically.
- [[Urbanization\|Urbanization]] is the process of concentrating larger populations into cities
	- Caused by [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Industrialisation\|Industrialisation]]
	- Before the industrial revolution, over 80% of the British were rural, by 1850 most people lived in cities
		- For murica it was 1900
- Urbanization was caused by rapid population growth in existing cities
	- London from 2 → 5 million in 1840 → 1880
- And small towns becoming industrial centers
	- Manchester, England went from 20,000 in 1770s onward to 180,000 in 1820
	- This was because of it's cool climate
	- It was close to a seaport & coalfields(steel production? & fuel)
	- all of this caused it to become a textile manufacturing giant
- Urbanization happened too fast for [[infrastructure\|infrastructure]] to be put into place
	- Big cities were often dirty, crowded, sick
# New Social & Spatial Forms
>The changes to society resulting from the Industrial Revolution were so extensive that we can touch only upon the most important. At the most general level, [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Industrialisation\|Industrialisation]] led to a new kind of economy with a new way of organizing society, industrial capitalism. A capitalist system implies a new set of social classes and a new set of relationships between them.
## Social Classes & Class Relations
- Landowners who gained more & more farmland and invested in [[Mechanization\|Mechanization]] became a new class of commercial farmers
	- They raise food & animals for money
- Workers who were displaced because of the consolidation had to sell labor for money
	- Wage labor is when someone pays a worker to do something, usually by day or hour
	- These people became the working class
- The employers became the capitalist class
- Later in the Industrial Revolution the middle class came
	- Made up of salaried professionals(go college, make money)
		- lawyers, educators, and physicians, and office workers, such as bank tellers and store clerks.
- People lived nearer others of the same class & shared similar lives([[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Centripetal Force\|Centripetal Force]])
	- Clothings, food, belief, norms, taboos, behaviour
- There was tension
	- Workers wanted better conditions and more money, so they made unions in order to bargain with capitalists
## New Divisions of Labor
>All societies have some means of dividing up tasks among people. At the most basic level, tasks are divided among members based primarily on age and gender.
- Assembly lines allowed for mass production of goods as each worker had one specific job in order to make a final product
## Effects on the Family
>In preindustrial society, agricultural families tended to organize themselves as a single unit of production. Women, men, and children were all involved in producing for the household. Even the youngest children contributed by tending livestock or fetching [[Periodic Table of Elements/And Compounds/Dihydrogen Oxide\|water]]. Women were prominent in home-based crafts, and men might be involved in both farming tasks and crafts. Child rearing was spread among adult men and women and older siblings. Family, work, and workplace were closely integrated.
- [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Industrialisation\|Industrialisation]] changed family dynamics
- Instead of everyone working, men went to factories or offices, some women went to the textile factory to work
	- Some stayed home to take care of children
- The caused gender roles to become more & more prominent
# New Experiences of Space and Time
- Peoples sense of time no longer depended on the seasons and such, but were rigid 24-hours or urban life
- Roads & better transportation allowed for someone's sense of reach to expand
# International Competition for Resources
>As [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Industrialisation\|Industrialisation]] diffused into mainland [[Europe\|Europe]], [[North America\|North America]], and Japan, competition for reliable sources of raw materials increased. It also became clear that new markets were needed to absorb the vast quantities of mass-produced goods. Therefore, industrializing countries turned to colonialism and imperialism to find more [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 1/Natural Resources\|natural resources]] and new markets.
- The US had lots of resources to use(Lumber, timer, coal, [[Periodic Table of Elements/Iron\|iron]]) but it was different for European countries & Japan, they had fewer resources and needed to expand
- Great Britain needed cotton to expand it's textile industry, but it's climate isn't good for the plants
	- India was the worlds largest producer of cotton, so Britain took it over, banned cotton importation, and formed a monopoly
- The Berlin conference(1884) allowed other European countries to do the same to Africa
	- Britain got Egypt & Sudan(cotton)
	- France got West Africa(cotton and veggie oils)
	- Belgium got Congo(rubber)
# International Competition for Markets
>Industrial capitalism requires a constantly expanding, reliable market in which to sell its manufactured goods. On its own, mass consumption, the purchase of large amounts of mass-produced goods by large numbers of people, is not enough.
- Sales drop off often after mass-producing → mass-consumption as people are satisfied
	- Consumers may return to the market after their shoes wear out
	- So profits drop
- Imperialism was so that European countries secure foreign markets for their mass-produced items
	- Which led to the [[international division of labor\|international division of labor]]
		- When different countries work together in and interdependent web in the economy
