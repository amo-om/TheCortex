#### Housing Discrimination: [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 6/Redlining\|Redlining]] and [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 6/Blockbusting\|Blockbusting]]
- **[[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 6/Redlining\|Redlining]]**: Practice of marking areas as high-risk for loans, often discriminating against minority neighborhoods.
- **[[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 6/Blockbusting\|Blockbusting]]**: Realtors inducing white homeowners to sell cheaply by suggesting the neighborhood is declining due to minority influx, then selling at higher prices to those minorities.

#### Housing Affordability
- **Affordability Issues**: Rising house prices and rents, leading to trade-offs like long commutes or overcrowded living conditions.
- **Government Assistance**: Housing choice voucher program helps, but doesn't cover security deposits, leaving many low-income families out of reach.

#### Access to Services
- **Challenges**: Poorer residents struggle to access city services like police protection, fire protection, and sanitation.
- **Solutions**: Cities try to place social service offices in or near low-income neighborhoods for better accessibility.

#### Urban Crime
- **Trends**: Significant decline in violent crime rates, but disadvantaged, segregated communities still disproportionately affected.
- **Hotspots**: Small areas within neighborhoods with higher crime rates, where policing can be effective.

#### Environmental Injustice
- **Definition**: Poor or immigrant groups facing more environmental risks than wealthier, established groups.
- **Examples**: Garbage dumps and sewage plants often located in poor neighborhoods; Flint water crisis as a case of environmental injustice.

#### [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 6/Shantytowns\|Squatter Settlements]]
- **Characteristics**: Inadequate, often illegal housing built by the poor with scavenged materials.
- **Challenges**: Lack of amenities like fresh water, electricity, and secure habitation.

#### Inclusionary Zoning
- **Purpose**: To create affordable housing options within new developments for low- and moderate-income families.

#### Local Food Movements
- **Goal**: To improve access to fresh, locally produced food, often as a response to food deserts in urban areas.

#### Urban Renewal and [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 6/Gentrification\|Gentrification]]
- **Urban Renewal**: Efforts to revitalize aging and rundown city areas through new construction and infrastructure improvements.
- **[[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 6/Gentrification\|Gentrification]]**: The process where new, often wealthier, residents move into a neighborhood, leading to displacement of lower-income residents.
  - **Negative Consequences**: Displacement of original residents, loss of affordable housing, and cultural erasure.

#### Fragmentation and Local Government
- **Challenges**: Lack of coordination among various districts providing services, leading to inefficiencies.
- **Solution**: Consolidation of services to reduce hierarchy and improve service delivery, though unpopular with officials and voters.
