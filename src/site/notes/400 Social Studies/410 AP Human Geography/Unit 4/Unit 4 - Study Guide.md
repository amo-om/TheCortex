>Define the different types of political entities.
# Independent [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/State\|States]] and Sovereignty
- **Most modern states are independent, ruling themselves** without the authority of another state.
- Exceptions exist, such as **Greenland (owned by Denmark) and unincorporated territories like Guam and Puerto Rico.**
- Some territories, like the British Virgin Islands, have self-governance while maintaining ties with a larger political entity.
- Independent states possess sovereignty, the right to control political and economic affairs within their boundaries without external interference.
- International law acknowledges states' boundaries, their right to exist independently, and their authority to govern.
## [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/Nation\|Nations]], [[Nation-States\|Nation-States]], and Nationalism
- **Nation:** A community with a common identity based on shared cultural traits (language, [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Ethnicity\|Ethnicity]], religion) and bound to a homeland.
- Examples include Native American nations, the Cornish people in the UK, and the Sami in Finland.
- **Nation-State:** An ideal political unit where the nation's boundaries match the state's territorial boundaries.
- Few contemporary states fit this ideal due to globalisation, but examples include Iceland, Finland, and the Koreas.
- **Nationalism:** A sense of collective identity and belonging to a national culture, often marked by state boundaries.
- Strong nationalism can lead to efforts to preserve cultural similarity, including restricting [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 2/Immigration\|Immigration]].
## Stateless Nations
- Some ethnic groups, like the Kurds, are divided by international boundaries and lack their own state.
- Stateless nations, like the Kurds, face challenges in seeking independence through political and military means.
## Multinational States, Colonialism, and Multistate Nations
- **Most countries today are multinational states**, containing multiple national, ethnic, and religious groups.
- Examples include **South Africa**, with its diverse languages, and the former Yugoslavia, which collapsed due to ethnic divisions.
- **Colonialism has left many contemporary states in Africa, [[Asia#South Asia\|South Asia]], and Southeast Asia ethnically and linguistically diverse.**
- Multistate nations, like the Yoruba in [[Africa#West Africa\|West Africa]], have populations divided among multiple states.
# Autonomous and Semiautonomous Regions
- **[[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/Autonomous Region\|Autonomous Region]]:** A section or territory with a degree of self-government (e.g., Native American reservations in the United States).
- **Semiautonomous Region:** Has some degree of self-government but not complete autonomy.
- Examples include Catalonia in Spain, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom, and Greenland as a semiautonomous Danish territory.
- Regions in western [[Europe\|Europe]], such as Corsica (France) and Flanders/Wallonia (Belgium), seek autonomy or self-rule.
# Key Questions

>[!tip]- Learning Goals
>Identify the concepts that shape the political geography of today’s world.
>
>Explain the processes that influence political boundaries.
# Introduction
- The contemporary world map, displaying political boundaries of about 200 countries, is the result of centuries-long processes explored in this module.
- Examines historical and present processes shaping national boundaries.
# Sovereignty and Self-Determination
- **Self-Determination:** A nation's ability to determine its statehood, allegiances, and government.
- Historical roots in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, tied to the right of culturally distinct groups to govern themselves.
- Examples include the American Revolution and the fragmentation of Russia after World War I.
- Enshrined in the [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/United Nations\|United Nations]] charter in 1945, influencing independence movements in Africa, [[South America\|South America]], and Southeast Asia.
- The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 resulted in the creation of 15 sovereign nation-states.
## Core Areas
- Some states expanded from core areas, geographic centers of power.
- Historical power centers formed around attractive resources and geographic features, growing outward with the support of major cities.
- Core areas remain crucial in countries that diffused from a core, unlike those created to fill a political void.
- Examples include France, China, and the United States.
- Countries without a political core, like Belgium and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, face challenges to national identity.
## The Physical Environment
- Political phenomena and spatial variations often linked to terrain, soils, climate, and [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 1/Natural Resources\|natural resources]].
- Natural protection, like mountains or coastlines, historically aided a country's survival.
- Territorial growth justified by doctrines like Manifest Destiny (U.S.) or the belief in Euro-American privilege (Russia).
# Sovereignty and Globalization
- Globalization, driven by the Internet, satellite communications, and free trade agreements, challenges nation-state sovereignty.
- Some argue that states' power diminishes as globalisation operates beyond international borders.
- Geographer John Agnew introduces the concept of effective sovereignty, where a state's power extends beyond its territory.
- Example: The U.S. exercises effective sovereignty over Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, despite being outside U.S. territory.
## Independence Movements
### Africa
- Colonialism's demise influenced by educated Africans exposed to Western political philosophy.
- Spread of political independence in Africa in the mid-20th century, overcoming hurdles like Portuguese resistance.
- Independence movements in Algeria, Zimbabwe, and [[Africa#South Africa\|South Africa]] marked by conflicts and delays.
### [[South America\|South America]]
- Independence movements in [[South America\|South America]] mirrored events leading to the Revolutionary War in the United States.
- Spanish and Portuguese elites frustrated with orders from [[Europe\|Europe]] led to wars for independence.
- Formation of South American countries during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
### Modern [[Europe\|Europe]]
- Nationalist movements in [[Europe\|Europe]], like Catalonia in Spain and Scotland in the UK, challenge state sovereignty.
- [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/Devolution\|Devolution]] explored as a movement of power from central to regional governments within a state.
## [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/Devolution\|Devolution]]
### Ethnocultural Forces and Ethnonationalism
- [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/Devolution\|Devolution]] driven by forces like [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Ethnicity\|Ethnicity]], language, and religion.
- Ethnonationalism supports political interests of ethnic groups seeking independence or self-determination.
- Examples include Czechoslovakia's peaceful division and conflicts in the former Yugoslavia.
### Economic Forces
- Economic factors contribute to [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/Devolution\|devolution]], as seen in Catalonia's desire for fiscal independence from Spain.
- Examples in Sardinia, Italy, and the Republic of the Pampas in Brazil.
### Territorial Forces
- [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/Devolution\|Devolution]] often occurs on state margins or islands, strengthened by distance from the capital.
- Examples include the United Kingdom's devolved regions, the Basques in Spain and France, and Puerto Rico's quasi-state status.
- Debate exists within separatist groups on achieving sovereignty, sometimes leading to terrorism or armed conflicts.
# Key Questions
>[!faq]- What is sovereignty
>Sovereignty is the authority of a state to govern itself and make decisions within its own borders.

>[!faq]- What is globalisation
>Globalization is the increasing connectedness and interdependence of economies, cultures, and societies on a global scale.

>Identify the concepts geographers use to describe political power.
>
Describe territoriality in political geography.
# Neocolonialism
- Colonialism allowed European countries to control overseas territories through direct rule, displacing native rulers.
- Neocolonialism, a modern form of political power, involves indirect domination of peripheral states by [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/Core States\|core states]].
- [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/Core States\|Core states]] (wealthy and powerful) exploit peripheral states (less wealthy) economically and politically, maintaining dependence.
- Examples in Africa and Latin America illustrate how former colonial rulers influence economies and hinder development.
## Neocolonialism in Africa:
- Dependence on a single cash crop (Cocoa), controlled by former colonizers, leads to economic vulnerability.
- Foreign aid often takes the form of high-interest loans, perpetuating poverty and hindering economic development.
## Neocolonialism in Latin America:
- Historical exploitation by foreign powers affected economies negatively.
- Paraguay resisted neocolonialism but faced conflict and economic collapse.
- Global farming businesses in developing countries contribute to neocolonial relationships.
# Shatterbelts
- Regions with persistent fragmentation due to [[400 Social Studies/410 AP Human Geography/Unit 4/Modules 25-32/Module 26 - Political Processes#Devolution\|devolution]], acting as buffer zones between hostile states.
- High religious, linguistic, and ethnic diversity, often containing important resources.
- Examples in East Central Europe, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and parts of Africa.
## The Eastern Europe Shatterbelt:
- Historical conflicts in the Balkan Peninsula due to cultural differences, foreign rule, and communist regimes.
- Tensions persist among new countries formed after the collapse of Yugoslavia, leading to regional instability.
# [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/Choke Points\|Choke Points]]
- Narrow features restricting passage to another [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 1/Region\|Region]], important in maritime trade.
- Strategic [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/Choke Points\|Choke Points]] include the Strait of Hormuz, Strait of Malacca, and Suez Canal.
## Strategic [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/Choke Points\|Choke Points]]:
- Strait of Hormuz: Vital for Persian Gulf oil exporters, potential for disruptions impacting global oil supply.
- Strait of Malacca: Shortest sea route for Persian Gulf oil to Asian markets, susceptible to blockades and piracy.
- Suez Canal: Connects Red Sea and Mediterranean, crucial for maritime trade, historical significance.
# Territoriality in Political Geography
- A political and cultural strategy claiming power over land, people, and resources.
- Boundaries, both international and internal, define territories and manage conflict.
- Enclaves, exclaves, and challenging territorial configurations affect governance.
## Geographic Variation in [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/Nation-State\|Nation-State]] Territories:
- World regions exhibit varying degrees of political fragmentation.
- Enclaves and exclaves, like Lesotho and Kaliningrad, pose governance challenges.
- Country shapes and configurations can impact stability and ease of control, but geography alone doesn't determine governance outcomes.
# Key Questions
>[!faq]- What is a choke point
>A choke point is a narrow feature restricting passage to another [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 1/Region\|Region]],

>[!faq]- What is territoriality in political geography
>Territoriality in political geography refers to how a government or group exercises control over a specific geographic area. Through borders.

# Types of Country Boundaries
- **Delimitation and Demarcation**: The process involves both delimitation, the identification of limits, and demarcation, the physical separation of those limits. The median line principle is an illustration, notably visible in the Delaware River.
## Relic Boundaries
- **Definition**: Relic boundaries, though obsolete as international borders, endure as cultural imprints in the landscape.
- **Examples**:
    - *Hadrian’s Wall*: Constructed in 122 CE to fortify the Roman Empire, it now stands as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, with remnants and hiking paths.
    - *Berlin Wall*: Erected post-World War II, it symbolized the division of East and West Germany until its dismantling in 1989.
## [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/Superimposed Boundaries\|Superimposed Boundaries]]
- **Definition**: Imposed without regard to existing cultural boundaries, often exacerbating conflicts.
- **Example**: Belgium's imposition of boundaries on Rwanda and Burundi during colonialism, illustrating the disregard for pre-existing cultural divisions.
## [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/Subsequent Boundaries\|Subsequent Boundaries]]
- **Definition**: Evolving with the [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Cultural Landscape\|Cultural Landscape]], set as groups settle in new territories.
- **Examples**:
    - *China-Vietnam Border*: Negotiated post-Lý–Song War, demarcated by rivers, formalized in the Treaty of Tientsin (1885).
    - *US-Canada Border*: Established through treaties like the Webster–Ashburton Treaty (1842), solidifying boundaries from Maine to Minnesota.
## [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/Antecedent Boundaries\|Antecedent Boundaries]]
- **Definition**: Identified before area settlement.
- **Examples**:
    - *49th Parallel*: Delimited in 1846 between the US and Canada.
    - *Malaysia-Indonesia Border on Borneo*: Outlined during the colonial period, defined by the Anglo–Dutch Treaty of 1891.
## [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/Geometric Boundaries\|Geometric Boundaries]]
- **Definition**: Regular, often straight lines irrespective of physical or cultural features.
- **Examples**:
    - *US-Canada Border West of Lake of the Woods*: An example of a geometric boundary.
    - *African Colonial Boundaries*: Often superimposed geometric lines, a consequence of colonial powers' division during decolonization.
## [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/Consequent Boundaries\|Consequent Boundaries]]
- **Definition**: Formed to accommodate existing cultural differences.
- **Examples**:
    - *China-Vietnam Border*: Also serving as a consequent boundary between two distinct cultures.
    - *Republic of Ireland-Northern Ireland Border*: Dividing along religious lines, primarily Protestant and Catholic.
## Demilitarized Zones
- **Definition**: Designated areas where treaties prohibit military activities.
- **Examples**:
    - *Korean Peninsula DMZ*: Fortified along latitude 38° N, it reflects historical geopolitical tensions.
    - *Idlib Demilitarization*: 2018 agreement between Turkey and Russia in Syria's Idlib [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 1/Region\|Region]], emphasizing conflict resolution.
# Political Agreements
## Berlin Conference
- **Context**: Convened in 1884–1885 to regulate European colonization in Africa.
- **Outcomes**: Resulted in colonial partitioning, overshadowing existing African autonomy, and establishing enduring boundaries post-WWII.
# Buffer States
- **Definition**: Independent yet politically and economically weak countries strategically positioned between powerful states.
- **Example**: Thailand, an independent state serving as a buffer between British and French colonial empires in [[Asia\|Asia]].
# Satellite States
- **Definition**: Nominally independent countries under the political, military, and economic control of a more powerful state.
- **Example**: Poland, transitioning into a Soviet satellite state post-WWII as part of the Eastern Bloc.
# The [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\|United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] ([[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\|UNCLOS]])
- **Definition**: Established in 1982, [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\|UNCLOS]] defines territorial boundaries and rights to the sea.
- **Significance**: Introduced four zones, particularly the [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/Exclusive Economic Zones\|Exclusive Economic Zone]] ([[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/Exclusive Economic Zones\|EEZ]]), altering geopolitical dynamics globally.
- **Example**: Spratly Islands dispute, highlighting the impact of [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\|UNCLOS]] on maritime claims.
# Global Warming and Rising Sea Levels
- **Impact on Boundaries**: Sea level rise (SLR) since the 1880s, accelerating, leading to changes in territorial boundaries, loss of access to fisheries, and potential international disputes.
- **Example**: Implications in the Arctic Circle, where melting ice opens new shipping routes.
- **Note**: Findings of international tribunals may not represent final outcomes in disputes.

# Voting Districts and Electoral Geography

## Voting Districts
- **Definition**: Territories designated for organizing voting, influencing election outcomes at various levels.
- **Example**: Purple Sage, Wyoming, serves as a microcosm, showcasing how a single voting district can influence local and national representation.
## Electoral College
- **Function**: The unique method employed in the U.S. for selecting the president, with 538 electors from states determining the outcome.
- **Impact**: Enables states with varying populations to have proportional influence, contributing to the complexity of presidential elections.
- **Challenge**: Instances like the 2000 and 2016 elections, where candidates won the popular vote but lost in the Electoral College, highlight its controversial nature.
# Reapportionment and Redistricting
## Congressional Reapportionment
- **Cycle**: Occurs every 10 years after the U.S. [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 1/Census\|Census]] to adjust the distribution of House seats based on population changes.
- **Outcome**: Shifts in political power, illustrated by states gaining or losing seats based on population fluctuations.
## Redistricting
- **Definition**: Drawing new boundaries for congressional districts after reapportionment.
- **Objective**: Maintain balanced representation and adapt to demographic changes.
- **Challenge**: Susceptibility to manipulation, as evidenced by the historic role of [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/Gerrymandering\|gerrymandering]].
# [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/Gerrymandering\|Gerrymandering]]

## Definition and Methods
- **[[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/Gerrymandering\|Gerrymandering]]**: Manipulating district boundaries to favor specific political parties or outcomes.
- **Methods**:
    - *Packing*: Concentrating opposition votes to create an artificially large majority.
    - *Cracking*: Dividing opposition votes across districts to dilute their impact.
## Gill v. Whitford in Wisconsin
- **Context**: U.S. Supreme Court case addressing alleged [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/Gerrymandering\|gerrymandering]] in Wisconsin.
- **Outcome**: Highlights the legal and democratic challenges associated with manipulating boundaries for political advantage.
## Geographic Implications
- **[[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 1/Geographic Information System\|GIS]] Technology**: Facilitates rapid redrawing of boundaries, posing a dilemma for democracy.
- **Impact**: The location of district boundaries can significantly influence election results, raising questions about fairness.
# Regions and Voting Behavior
## Red State/Blue State Dynamics
- **Analysis**: Commonly used to depict regional political preferences.
- **Limitations**: Oversimplifies complex voting patterns, especially in states with large areas but sparse populations.
- **Introduction of Purple State**: A nuanced approach to acknowledge the diversity within states and challenge binary categorizations.
## County-Level Analysis
- **Nuanced Perspective**: County-level results reveal variations not captured by state-level distinctions.
- **Complexities Unveiled**: Shading of colors provides a more accurate representation of political and cultural differences.
## Three-Dimensional Analysis
- **Cities vs. Rural Divide**: Utilizing height to represent voters per square mile unveils the urban-rural political dynamic.
- **Insights**: Rural areas mainly Republican, while cities lean Democratic, showcasing geographic disparities in voting behavior.
# Key Questions
>[!faq]- How can voting outcomes reflect regional differences?
>Dividing the United States into “red states” and “blue states” is very simplistic and gives the illusion of deep regionalization in voter preferences in U.S. presidential elections.

>[!faq]- What is [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/Gerrymandering\|gerrymandering]]
>[[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/Gerrymandering\|Gerrymandering]] is the manipulation of district boundaries to favor a particular political party or group.

- **Characteristics**:
  - *Top-Down Governance*: Decisions originate from the central government.
  - *National Imposition*: Strict laws uniformly applied across the territory.
- **Examples**: France, Japan, Republic of Ireland, Saudi Arabia, China.
## Federal States
- **Definition**: Dispersed authority, empowering subnational units with significant autonomy.
- **Characteristics**:
  - *Decentralized Power*: Local governments enact laws, levy taxes, and administer regions.
  - *Reduced Centrifugal Forces*: Mitigates separatist movements.
- **Examples**: United States, Canada, Germany, [[Australia\|Australia]], Switzerland.

- **Challenges**: Criticisms for suppressing freedoms and centralizing power.
## Iceland
- **Case Study**: Iceland, a unitary state with a unique governance model.
- **Administrative Levels**: National government and local councils.
- **Regional Divide**: Eight regions for statistical purposes, devoid of administrative powers.
- **Cultural Harmony**: Absence of ethnic divisiveness, due to its remote location.
# Spatial Organization of Federal States
## Belgium
- **Case Study**: Belgium exemplifies federalism with regions based on language and culture.
- **Cultural Divide**: Flemish (Dutch) in Flanders, French in Wallonia.
- **Administrative Autonomy**: Regional parliaments and governments for Flanders and Wallonia.
- **Central Oversight**: Central government supervises local decisions.
# Autonomous Regions
## Native American Reservations
- **Unique Structure**: Reservations as autonomous regions within the U.S. [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/Federal System\|federal system]].
- **Treaty Origins**: Derivation from treaties between U.S. government and Native American nations.
- **Self-Governance**: Rights to elect tribal leaders and distinct legal rights.

>
>Explain how devolutionary challenges occur at different scales.
>
>Explain how innovations in communication technology challenge sovereignty.
>
>Identify why supranational organizations are formed and how they challenge state sovereignty.
# Devolutionary Forces:
1. **Ethnic Cleansing:** Involves the forced removal of an [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Ethnicity\|ethnic group]] by another to create ethnically homogeneous territories. Examples include the ethnic wars in Yugoslavia, genocide in Sudan's Darfur [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 1/Region\|Region]], and ethnic cleansing in Myanmar against the Rohingya.
2. **Terrorism:** Involves the calculated use of violence against civilians and symbolic targets to publicize a cause, intimidate, or coerce. Examples range from international terrorism like the 9/11 attacks to domestic terrorism such as the Oklahoma City bombing.
3. **[[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/Irredentism\|Irredentism]]:** Occurs when an ethnic majority ruling one country seeks to reunite with people of the same [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Ethnicity\|Ethnicity]] who are minorities in a neighboring country. For instance, Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.
4. **Disintegration of States:** Sometimes, smaller, culturally homogenous regions decide to break off from larger states. The example here is South Sudan, which gained independence from Sudan but still faces internal and external conflicts.
**Maintaining Sovereignty in the Internet Age:**
Governments attempt to impose their laws and defend cultural norms in the Internet age. Countries may restrict access to technological hardware or control the information citizens receive. Examples include China's Great Firewall, censorship agreements with companies like Google, and efforts to counteract pro-Hong Kong activism.
**Supranationalism:**

Supranationalism occurs when nation-states cede some sovereign rights to a larger political body. Examples include the [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/United Nations\|United Nations]] ([[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/United Nations\|UN]]), [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/European Union\|European Union]] (EU), and [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/African Union\|African Union]] (AU).
**[[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/United Nations\|UN]], EU, and AU:**
