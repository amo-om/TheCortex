# Devolutionary Forces:
1. **Ethnic Cleansing:** Involves the forced removal of an [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Ethnicity\|ethnic group]] by another to create ethnically homogeneous territories. Examples include the ethnic wars in Yugoslavia, genocide in Sudan's Darfur [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 1/Region\|Region]], and ethnic cleansing in Myanmar against the Rohingya.
2. **Terrorism:** Involves the calculated use of violence against civilians and symbolic targets to publicize a cause, intimidate, or coerce. Examples range from international terrorism like the 9/11 attacks to domestic terrorism such as the Oklahoma City bombing.
3. **[[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/Irredentism\|Irredentism]]:** Occurs when an ethnic majority ruling one country seeks to reunite with people of the same [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 3/Ethnicity\|Ethnicity]] who are minorities in a neighboring country. For instance, Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.
4. **Disintegration of States:** Sometimes, smaller, culturally homogenous regions decide to break off from larger states. The example here is South Sudan, which gained independence from Sudan but still faces internal and external conflicts.
**Maintaining Sovereignty in the Internet Age:**
Governments attempt to impose their laws and defend cultural norms in the Internet age. Countries may restrict access to technological hardware or control the information citizens receive. Examples include China's Great Firewall, censorship agreements with companies like Google, and efforts to counteract pro-Hong Kong activism.
**Supranationalism:**
In recent decades, globalisation has led countries to relinquish some territorial sovereignty in exchange for greater global power. Supranationalism occurs when nation-states cede some sovereign rights to a larger political body. Examples include the [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/United Nations\|United Nations]] ([[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/United Nations\|UN]]), [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/European Union\|European Union]] (EU), and [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/African Union\|African Union]] (AU).
**[[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/United Nations\|UN]], EU, and AU:**
- **[[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/United Nations\|United Nations]] ([[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/United Nations\|UN]]):** Established in 1945, it consists of 193 member states and aims to maintain international peace and security. The [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/United Nations\|UN]] Security Council plays a crucial role in addressing threats and acts of aggression.

- **[[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/European Union\|European Union]] (EU):** Formed in 1993, it's a political, economic, and social union of 28 European countries. It promotes the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital among its members. The EU requires member nations to give up some sovereign powers.

- **[[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/African Union\|African Union]] (AU):** Launched in 2002, it seeks to defend the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and independence of its member states. The AU aims for greater unity, solidarity, economic development, and democratic principles in Africa.
**Transnational and Environmental Challenges:**
Organizations like UNESCO and the [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/Arctic Council\|Arctic Council]] address challenges that cross borders, emphasizing cooperation for peace, sustainable development, and environmental protection.
**Trade Agreements:**
Regional trading blocs like NAFTA-USMCA and ASEAN aim to reduce or eliminate taxes, promote the free flow of goods and services, achieve economies of scale, and facilitate economic growth among member countries.
**Military Alliances:**
Military alliances, such as NATO, involve intergovernmental cooperation for political and military purposes, ensuring the freedom and security of member countries.
# Key Questions
>[!faq]- How do devolutionary challenges occur at different scales?
>Devolutionary can occur at the [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Misc./Regional Scale\|regional scale]] which can make new states, or even dissolve an entire [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/State\|State]] 

>[!faq]- How do innovations in communication technology challenge sovereignty?
>The internet gets rid of political boundaries due to interconnectedness causing a loss of [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/State\|State]] sovereignty
