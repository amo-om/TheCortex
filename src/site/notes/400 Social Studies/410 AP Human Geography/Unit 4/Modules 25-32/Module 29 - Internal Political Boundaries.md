# Voting Districts and Electoral Geography

## Voting Districts
- **Definition**: Territories designated for organizing voting, influencing election outcomes at various levels.
- **Example**: Purple Sage, Wyoming, serves as a microcosm, showcasing how a single voting district can influence local and national representation.
## Electoral College
- **Function**: The unique method employed in the U.S. for selecting the president, with 538 electors from states determining the outcome.
- **Impact**: Enables states with varying populations to have proportional influence, contributing to the complexity of presidential elections.
- **Challenge**: Instances like the 2000 and 2016 elections, where candidates won the popular vote but lost in the Electoral College, highlight its controversial nature.
# Reapportionment and Redistricting
## Congressional Reapportionment
- **Cycle**: Occurs every 10 years after the U.S. [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 1/Census\|Census]] to adjust the distribution of House seats based on population changes.
- **Outcome**: Shifts in political power, illustrated by states gaining or losing seats based on population fluctuations.
## Redistricting
- **Definition**: Drawing new boundaries for congressional districts after reapportionment.
- **Objective**: Maintain balanced representation and adapt to demographic changes.
- **Challenge**: Susceptibility to manipulation, as evidenced by the historic role of [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/Gerrymandering\|gerrymandering]].
# [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/Gerrymandering\|Gerrymandering]]

## Definition and Methods
- **[[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/Gerrymandering\|Gerrymandering]]**: Manipulating district boundaries to favor specific political parties or outcomes.
- **Methods**:
    - *Packing*: Concentrating opposition votes to create an artificially large majority.
    - *Cracking*: Dividing opposition votes across districts to dilute their impact.
## Gill v. Whitford in Wisconsin
- **Context**: U.S. Supreme Court case addressing alleged [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/Gerrymandering\|gerrymandering]] in Wisconsin.
- **Outcome**: Highlights the legal and democratic challenges associated with manipulating boundaries for political advantage.
## Geographic Implications
- **[[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 1/Geographic Information System\|GIS]] Technology**: Facilitates rapid redrawing of boundaries, posing a dilemma for democracy.
- **Impact**: The location of district boundaries can significantly influence election results, raising questions about fairness.
# Regions and Voting Behavior
## Red State/Blue State Dynamics
- **Analysis**: Commonly used to depict regional political preferences.
- **Limitations**: Oversimplifies complex voting patterns, especially in states with large areas but sparse populations.
- **Introduction of Purple State**: A nuanced approach to acknowledge the diversity within states and challenge binary categorizations.
## County-Level Analysis
- **Nuanced Perspective**: County-level results reveal variations not captured by state-level distinctions.
- **Complexities Unveiled**: Shading of colors provides a more accurate representation of political and cultural differences.
## Three-Dimensional Analysis
- **Cities vs. Rural Divide**: Utilizing height to represent voters per square mile unveils the urban-rural political dynamic.
- **Insights**: Rural areas mainly Republican, while cities lean Democratic, showcasing geographic disparities in voting behavior.
# Key Questions
>[!faq]- How can voting outcomes reflect regional differences?
>Dividing the United States into “red states” and “blue states” is very simplistic and gives the illusion of deep regionalization in voter preferences in U.S. presidential elections.

>[!faq]- What is [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/Gerrymandering\|gerrymandering]]
>[[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/Gerrymandering\|Gerrymandering]] is the manipulation of district boundaries to favor a particular political party or group.
