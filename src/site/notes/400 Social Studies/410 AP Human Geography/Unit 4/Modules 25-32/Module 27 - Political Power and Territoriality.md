>Identify the concepts geographers use to describe political power.
>
Describe territoriality in political geography.
# Neocolonialism
- Colonialism allowed European countries to control overseas territories through direct rule, displacing native rulers.
- Neocolonialism, a modern form of political power, involves indirect domination of peripheral states by [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/Core States\|core states]].
- [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/Core States\|Core states]] (wealthy and powerful) exploit peripheral states (less wealthy) economically and politically, maintaining dependence.
- Examples in Africa and Latin America illustrate how former colonial rulers influence economies and hinder development.
## Neocolonialism in Africa:
- Dependence on a single cash crop (Cocoa), controlled by former colonizers, leads to economic vulnerability.
- Foreign aid often takes the form of high-interest loans, perpetuating poverty and hindering economic development.
## Neocolonialism in Latin America:
- Historical exploitation by foreign powers affected economies negatively.
- Paraguay resisted neocolonialism but faced conflict and economic collapse.
- Global farming businesses in developing countries contribute to neocolonial relationships.
# Shatterbelts
- Regions with persistent fragmentation due to [[400 Social Studies/410 AP Human Geography/Unit 4/Modules 25-32/Module 26 - Political Processes#Devolution\|devolution]], acting as buffer zones between hostile states.
- High religious, linguistic, and ethnic diversity, often containing important resources.
- Examples in East Central Europe, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and parts of Africa.
## The Eastern Europe Shatterbelt:
- Historical conflicts in the Balkan Peninsula due to cultural differences, foreign rule, and communist regimes.
- Tensions persist among new countries formed after the collapse of Yugoslavia, leading to regional instability.
# [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/Choke Points\|Choke Points]]
- Narrow features restricting passage to another [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 1/Region\|Region]], important in maritime trade.
- Strategic [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/Choke Points\|Choke Points]] include the Strait of Hormuz, Strait of Malacca, and Suez Canal.
## Strategic [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/Choke Points\|Choke Points]]:
- Strait of Hormuz: Vital for Persian Gulf oil exporters, potential for disruptions impacting global oil supply.
- Strait of Malacca: Shortest sea route for Persian Gulf oil to Asian markets, susceptible to blockades and piracy.
- Suez Canal: Connects Red Sea and Mediterranean, crucial for maritime trade, historical significance.
# Territoriality in Political Geography
- A political and cultural strategy claiming power over land, people, and resources.
- Boundaries, both international and internal, define territories and manage conflict.
- Enclaves, exclaves, and challenging territorial configurations affect governance.
## Geographic Variation in [[Flashcards/Social Studies/APHG/Unit 4/Nation-State\|Nation-State]] Territories:
- World regions exhibit varying degrees of political fragmentation.
- Enclaves and exclaves, like Lesotho and Kaliningrad, pose governance challenges.
- Country shapes and configurations can impact stability and ease of control, but geography alone doesn't determine governance outcomes.
# Key Questions

>[!faq]- What is territoriality in political geography
