# The First Year Topic Research Samples

Each year, an overarching research topic is chosen for all the first-year writing students. This overarching topic gives students common ground for exchanging knowledge and reviewing written work. Inside the large topic, you will narrow to a subtopic and focus on a specific controversy of your choosing. Since we are focusing on reading and writing skills in Module 1, we are providing a common list of articles about our First Year Topic on a special page called [First Year Topic Research Samples](https://onramps.instructure.com/courses/4072741/pages/1-dot-8-first-year-topic-research-samples?wrap=1 "1.8 First Year Topic Research Samples"). Your Instructor will refer to the First Year Topic Research Samples for class activities. In Module 2, you will start building your own research portfolio. As the semester progresses, you will draw more and more from your own research.
