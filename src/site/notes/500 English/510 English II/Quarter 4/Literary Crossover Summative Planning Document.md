Title: 'Road Spent'
Author: Jewel
>**I could stand to be alone  
for some time  
Lose myself in white noise  
slip into the blur  
contemplate the color yellow  
Right now  
I just don’t handle splashes too well  
Or too many teeth  
around me all at once  
armed like guns with something to say  
Urgent whispers  
hoarse restraint  
Quiet as paper cuts  
people steal me away  
cart my flesh off in tiny crimson piles  
my bones have been sore  
Rattling against each other  
in their anemic cage  
ravens circling  
my [[heart\|heart]] beating  
it’s-time to-go it’s-time to-go  
someplace full of surf  
full of flat blue sky  
full of shuuushhh**
