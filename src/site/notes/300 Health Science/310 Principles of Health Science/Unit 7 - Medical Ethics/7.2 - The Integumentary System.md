>The [[integumentary system\|integumentary system]] is **commonly known as the skin.** This system *forms a protective barrier around the organs of the body*. It keeps out ==[[pathogens\|pathogens]] and prevents injury to internal organs==. It helps to **regulate body temperature and eliminates waste through [[Flashcards/Health Science/PHS/sweat gland\|sweat glands]]**. The integumentary system also **senses [[Flashcards/Health Science/PHS/stimuli\|stimuli]]**, which allows the body to react to changing environmental conditions. As a health care worker, you should know the structure and functions of the integumentary system in order to treat disorders that may damage [[skin\|skin]] and make the body more vulnerable to injury or disease.
# Introduction to the [[Integumentary System\|Integumentary System]]
The skin is the body’s largest organ and is the first line of defense against infection. It contains several kinds of tissue, including epithelial, connective, and nerve tissue. This makes up our skin, hair, and nails. It also contains sweat and oil glands. The combination of these tissues and glands works together as the integumentary system. The main functions of the [[Integumentary System\|skin]] are to:
- Protect the underlying body parts from injury and the invasion of [[pathogens\|pathogens]] 
- Regulate body temperature by controlling the loss of body heat 
- Eliminate wastes through perspiration
- Store energy in the form of fat and [[vitamins\|vitamins]]
- Sense touch, heat, cold, pain, and pressure through receptors
- Produce vitamin D

## Structure of the [[Integumentary System\|Skin]]
[[Integumentary System\|Skin]] is made up of three main layers:
- The **[[Flashcards/Health Science/PHS/epidermis\|epidermis]]** is the outermost layer and has no [[blood vessels\|blood vessels]]. These cells are constantly sloughed off.
- The **[[Flashcards/Health Science/PHS/dermis\|dermis]]** is just beneath the [[Flashcards/Health Science/PHS/epidermis\|epidermis]] and contains many blood vessels. New cells are continually forming to replace those lost from the [[Flashcards/Health Science/PHS/epidermis\|epidermis]]. These cells come from the stratum germinativum layer of the [[Flashcards/Health Science/PHS/epidermis\|epidermis]].  
- Subcutaneous means “under the skin,” and the **[[Flashcards/Health Science/PHS/subcutaneous tissue\|subcutaneous tissue]]** layer connects the skin to muscle.
As noted above, the [[integumentary system\|integumentary system]] also includes hair, nails, and cutaneous glands. Hair is an outgrowth of [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Proteins\|protein]]; it projects from the [[Flashcards/Health Science/PHS/epidermis\|epidermis]], though it grows from hair follicles deep in the [[Flashcards/Health Science/PHS/dermis\|dermis]]. Nails, which are made of a tough [[Flashcards/Science/Biology/Proteins\|protein]] called keratin, are produced from living skin cells in the fingers and toes. Cutaneous glands include:
- **[[Sweat glands\|Sweat glands]]**, that excrete sweat to regulate temperature
- **[[Flashcards/Health Science/PHS/sebaceous glands\|sebaceous glands]]**, oil-producing glands that keep skin and hair moist
- **[[Flashcards/Health Science/PHS/ceruminous glands\|ceruminous glands]]**, located in the ear canal that produce earwax (cerumen)
- **[[Flashcards/Health Science/PHS/mammary glands\|mammary glands]]**, the milk-producing glands located in the breast
## Skin Conditions
| Condition | Disorder | Symptoms | Preventative Measures/Treatment |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| [[300 Health Science/Diseases-Conditions/Acne\|Acne]] | Blockage of pores of skin by hair, sebum, [[bacteria\|bacteria]] and dead skin cells | Blackheads, whiteheads, nodules and other types of pimples | Topical medications like [[benzoyl peroxide\|benzoyl peroxide]], [[salicylic acid\|salicylic acid]] or [[retinol\|retinol]]. [[Antibiotics\|Antibiotics]] control surface [[bacteria\|bacteria]] and oral contraception can help with breakouts associated with menstrual cycles. [[Isotretinoin\|Isotretinoin]] ([[Accutane\|Accutane]]) is used for the most severe cases. |
| [[300 Health Science/Diseases-Conditions/Alopecia\|Alopecia]] | Patchy areas of hair loss due to an [[autoimmune disorder\|autoimmune disorder]] | Hair loss | No cure but some treatments may help hair re-grow more quickly, such as corticosteroids.  Other medications may promote hair growth, such as [[Minoxidil\|Minoxidil]]. |
| [[Athlete’s Foot\|Athlete’s Foot]] ([[Athlete’s Foot\|tinea pedis]]) | Caused by a [[fungus\|fungus]]. It usually involves the toes and the soles of the feet but is occasionally found on the hands | Itching, scaling, and sometimes painful lesions | For prevention, wearing shoes that do not constrict feet and allow good air circulation. Dry feet well after bathing and lightly apply powder between toes. Treating with (anti-fungal) medication may also be effective |
| [[Eczema\|Atopic Dermatitis]]/[[Eczema\|Eczema]] | Reddened areas on the surface of the skin | Early stage—areas on the skin may be red, swollen, and weeping purulent  fluid. Later stage—usually reddened, scaly, itchy areas on the skin. | Avoiding allergens. Topical applications and medication may be helpful as a treatment |
| [[300 Health Science/Diseases-Conditions/Boils\|Boils]] | Skin abscess caused when  bacteria enters the hair follicles or [[Flashcards/Health Science/PHS/sebaceous glands\|sebaceous glands]] | Pain, redness, and swelling | To prevent spreading of infection, it is important to avoid irritating or squeezing the lesion. Treatment may include antibiotics and local moist heat. Incision and drainage may be necessary |
